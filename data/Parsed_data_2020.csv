Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced an ex-gratia of ₹5 lakh to the next of kin of the eight persons who died due to the impact of Cyclone Nivar in the State. Of the eight, six belonged to Chittoor district and two to Kadapa .

Mr. Reddy arrived at the Renigunta airport here on Saturday from where he conducted an aerial survey over the three contiguous districts of Chittoor, SPSR Nellore and Kadapa that had borne the brunt of the cyclone. He watched the fields and residential localities that remained submerged under water and gave instructions to the respective district Collectors to arrange ex-gratia payment at the earliest, without having to wait for formalities. Similarly, he directed the officials to get the crop loss estimated and submit a report by December 15.

After the Chief Minister departed, the Deputy Chief Ministers K. Narayanaswamy, S.B. Amzath Basha, Cabinet Ministers Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy (Panchayat Raj) and Anil Kumar Yadav (Irrigation) gave specific directions to the official machinery to expedite the estimation process.

Speaking to the media later, they explained that the Government would immediately focus on relief and restoration in the short term and also study the long term plans needed to address similar situations in future. Mr. Basha said the reasons behind the release of excess water from Araniar and Pincha projects and the need to expand their capacity at a minimal cost to ensure higher storage would be seriously pursued.

“The capacity of the Pincha project will be increased to store 2 TMC and Annamayya project to 10 TMC so as to make use of such flood water. The irrigation officials have been instructed to this effect to prepare Detailed Project Reports (DPR)”, he said.

Mr. Basha said that horticulture, paddy and Bengal gram crops had suffered huge losses due to inundation, but added that the details would be shared after proper estimation. “The Chief Minister has instructed the officials to take a humane view of the issue and see that no farmer is left with tears in his eyes”, he said, in response to a query on the quantum of support expected.

On the Buggavanka stream passing through Kadapa city that had flooded low-lying several colonies, he said Mr. Reddy had immediately sanctioned ₹39 crore for completing the revetment wall and also for its further extension.

Gandhinagar: Union Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala on Monday said most farmers in the country are in favour of the Centre's new farm laws , and there is no need to bring the MSP under purview of law as demanded by the protesting farmers. The BJP leader also urged the farmers, who are protesting at various Delhi borders since November 26, to return to the discussion table and find an amicable solution to the deadlock.""The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is part of the government's mechanism (to safeguard farmers from fall in agri produce prices) and it will remain in force in future too,"" Rupala told reporters at the Gujarat BJP headquarters here.""In fact, it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi who had first decided to introduce this MSP formula of agricultural cost plus 50 per cent profit as recommended by Dr Swaminathan,"" he said.Neither there is a need to bring a separate law for the MSP nor the provision is required to be included in the existing Acts, the minister said.""The MSP is being implemented by both the Centre and states, and there is no need to bring MSP under the purview of law,"" Rupala said, when asked to comment on the demand for it from the protesting farmers.He asked the opposition Congress why it did not make a law for MSP when the party was in power before 2014.""The recently introduced laws do not affect the MSP at all. These three laws were introduced for the benefit of farmers, not the government,"" he said.""Majority of farmers have welcomed these laws. I urge the agitating farmers to end the stalemate by holding discussion with the government to find an amicable solution,"" he said.The minister said the three farm laws were enacted ""on the request of farmers and their organisations"" and most of them are happy with it.""PM Modiji has taken many steps to double farmers' income. As part of that endeavour, the Centre had deposited Rs 95,000 crores into farmers' bank accounts,"" he said.There is no need for farmers to be skeptical about the PM's intentions, he said.""Let the laws get implemented first. The government will take steps if something does not suit you afterwards. But, opposing the laws upfront is improper,"" he said.On one of the laws about contract farming, Rupala accused the Congress of ""taking a lead in spreading false propaganda"" that farmers would lose their land to big corporates due to provisions of the law.This law is about the price and quality of the farm produce and about the tenure. There is no mention of land in the entire law, he said.""Yet, some people, led by the Congress, are trying to spread false propaganda that farmers will lose their land,"" Rupala said.He said the law about the APMC (agriculture produce market committees) only gives options to farmers and it does not eliminate the present system of mandis.Farmers have been protesting against the the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.",news,"""The Minimum Support Price (MSP) is part of the government's mechanism (to safeguard farmers from fall in agri produce prices) and it will remain in force in future too,"" Rupala told reporters at the Gujarat BJP headquarters here.

Although Janata Dal (S) members too opposed the Bill and sought a division of votes, chairman K. Pratapchandra Shetty did not allow it. This came a day after the Council adopted the controversial land reforms Bill amidst protests. The APMC Bill too has been widely opposed by farmers.

While Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar maintained that the Bill was brought to “help farmers” by relieving them from the clutches of middlemen, Leader of Opposition in the Council S.R Patil described it as “anti-farmer” and expressed concern that it would sound the death knell for farmers. He alleged that the APMC amendment was being pushed by the Centre to benefit multi-national companies.

Arguing that the Centre did not have powers under the Constitution to intervene with respect to APMCs that came under the State list, he urged the State government to desist from ‘succumbing’ to the Centre’s pressure.

Congress members P.R. Ramesh and B.K. Hariprasad pointed out that the provisions under the amendments will prevent the government from procuring grains from farmers for public distribution. “This will in turn deprive the poor of PDS grains,” they said.

While Mr. Hariprasad termed the Bill as “draconian” and demanded that it be referred to a joint select committee for further deliberations, Mr. Ramesh alleged that now farmers would be at the mercy of private companies.

“Despite objections from the Opposition parties, the government had promulgated an Ordinance in May that aimed at amending the laws to curtail the powers of the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC). The Ordinance has diluted the APMC laws and affected farmers’ interests. The amendments will only help big private companies as it will clip the powers of the APMCs,” Mr. Ramesh charged. JD(S) member Marithibbe Gowda alleged that the Centre was under pressure from multi-national companies and corporates to take up such an amendment. “The Central government is akin to British government,” he charged.

Referring to the concept of MSP, he wanted to know if such measures to protect farmers’ interest would continue in the new system. However, Mr. Somashekhar said the State government is committed to the welfare of farmers. Assuring members that the government would not allow any “injustice” to farmers, he said the MSP system would continue.

“After the Ordinance was promulgated, we did not receive a single complaint from farmers. The amendment was necessary because farmers and traders were being harassed by traffic police and vigilance department officials. They have paid a penalty of nearly ₹25 crore so far. Our aim is to stop this. The amendment will enable anyone with a PAN card to do business with farmers,” he said. Not satisfied with his reply, the Congress members staged a walkout.",news,"The Legislative Council on Wednesday adopted the Karnataka Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation and Development) (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which seeks to permit farmers to sell their produce outside the APMC, amidst walkout by the Opposition Congress members.

MADURAI : Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Tuesday said explanation would be sought from party Rajya Sabha member S R Balasubramaniam ( SRB ) for criticising the agriculture bills during the debate in the House.SRB’s views were diametrically opposite to the party’s stand, which EPS himself had made clear a day earlier.

It was benefiting farmers, he said. Ironically, the DMK, which is opposing the central legislations, had supported the state legislation, which is identical in nature.“Misled by politicians, who lack understanding of the agriculture sector, there are protests by farmers. The opposition parties also are protesting,” he said. The CM said the bills would not affect the minimum support price, which is already in vogue, and urged the farmer community not to heed to the false propaganda of the opposition. He rubbished the claim that corporates and traders would gain control of the farm lands. Hereafter, farmers will not have to destroy crops owing to steep fall in prices of commodities, especially tomatoes, he said.Reacting to the demand for a second capital, he said, “Every district is asking (to be announced as second capital).

Food has been a recurring theme in the ongoing farmers' protest against the Centre's three contentious farm laws. The farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are sitting in protest at Delhi's borders for over a month now. On Wednesday, the sixth round of talks between the protesting farmer unions and Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash took place at the national capital's Vigyan Bhawan.

However, what grabbed everyone's attention was that the Union ministers were seen sharing the langar (community kitchen) food arranged by protesting farmers. The langar food arrived in a van at the meeting venue, Vigyan Bhawan, after around two hours of discussions had taken place and the two sides took a break for tea and snacks. The three ministers were seen standing in a queue to take food along by 41 farmer leaders during the break. This gains much significance as the latest meeting is aimed to break the deadlock over the demand of the farmers to repeal the three laws and other issues.

Getting no positive signal from the Central government about rolling back the three contentious farm laws enacted in September, farmers protesting on the national capital's different borders on Saturday announced their plan to expand the demonstrations and expand them to a 'pan-India' scale, appealing all sections of society, including girls and women, to join them.

Declaring that they'll hold a day long 'hunger strike' on December 14, farmers representatives of 32 different unions jointly announced their plans for a 'pan-India' protest if the government does not accept their demands and withdraws the three laws -- The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

Addressing a press conference at Singhu border, Kisan Sangharsh Samiti President Kawalpreet Singh Pannu said: ""We have decided to expand this movement pan India.""

The farm leader said that farmers will move from Rajasthan's Shajapur to Delhi borders blocking the Delhi-Jaipur route on Sunday and all District Collector offices would become the Centre of the protest on December 14.

Announcing that all the leaders of 32 unions would sit on a day-long hunger strike at the Singhu border protest site from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on December 14, Pannu sought support from other sections of society.

""We request our sisters and mothers to become part of the protest. We are arranging for the seating, sleeping and hygiene facilities for women protesters. We appeal the girls and women across India to join the protest.""

He, however, made it clear ""we want to keep this movement as peaceful as it can."".

The farm leader said ""we have already rejected the proposal of the government, telling it about the lapses in the law"".

""The government had been saying since the beginning that these laws are for the benefit of farmers but we had told them that it is for the corporate houses,"" Pannu said.

It was the 17th day of farmers' protest on Delhi's different borders. Thousands of farmers, who began their sit-in from Singhu border on Delhi-Chandigarh border on November 26, are braving the chilly winter under open skies. The protest has hampered the supply chain to the national capital.

Despite five rounds of talks between the government and the farmers, there is no solution in sight as both side are adamant on their points. Farmers are demanding the repeal of three farm laws calling ""black laws"" and ""anti-farmer"" but the government is not ready for a rollback. As per government, it is ready for amendments to the laws but these cannot be repealed, reiterating that they are for the benefit of farmers.

Regional military commander Lt. Gen. Corleto Vinluan Jr. said troops rescued Rex Triplitt on Wednesday after his abductors fled during the clash in the hinterlands of Sirawai town in southern Zamboanga del Norte province.

Triplitt was taken to a clinic in Sirawai for a checkup, he said. A picture provided by the military showed a weary looking Triplitt holding a bottle of water and posing with government forces.

Triplitt is the Filipino son of an American who lived in a farming community in Sirawai. He was kidnapped there on Sept. 16 while riding a motorcycle with his wife and son on their way home. The gunmen left behind his wife and son, who reported the abduction, police said last month. He has been variously described as a farmer and a businessman who buys and sells land for a living.

Army troops received a tipoff from villagers about the presence of five armed men in a remote village in Sirawai and launched a raid, military officials said.

When the five engaged with the operating troops, Mr. Triplitt found an opportunity to hide and ask for help, Maj. Gen. Generoso Ponio said.

The abductors belonged to an Abu Sayyaf faction led by Injam Yadah which thrived on ransom kidnappings and was based in southern Sulu province, military officials said.

The United States and the Philippines have blacklisted the small but violent group for kidnappings and beheadings. Facing frequent government offensives in their jungle bases in Sulu and outlying island provinces in recent years, the gunmen have traveled far in search of kidnap victims to raise funds.

In a rather unfortunate turn of events, BJP leader Amit Malviya's efforts to fact check a post by Congress' Rahul Gandhi has earned him a warning label from Twitter. The posts in question had pertained to allegations of police brutality amid the ongoing farmer agitation in and around the national capital.

It began with a photo tweeted by Gandhi on November 28. ""This is a very sad photo. Our slogan was 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan', but today a soldier is standing against the farmer due to PM Modi's arrogance. This is very dangerous,"" he wrote in Hindi sharing a picture of a soldier brandishing a baton at an old farmer. The photo was shared by others including Congress leader Shashi Tharoor.

This photo and associated video has since been shared by many other well known handles who have hit out at the Modi government over the recent situation. And as many took it upon themselves to lambast the government over the alleged attacks against farmers, others rushed to fact check the visuals.

""Rahul Gandhi must be the most discredited opposition leader India has seen in a long long time,"" tweeted BJP IT Cell Chief Amit Malviya sharing two video clips. ""Propaganda"" and ""Reality"" he captioned the clips.

Unfortunately, Twitter does not seem to be in agreement with this assessment of reality, and Malviya's post has been flagged by the micro-blogging site as containing ""manipulated media"".

Twitter claims attached to posts by well known and highly followed officials have become something of a trend recently. US President Donald Trump's posts have being thus labelled with alarming frequency in recent weeks.

In this particular case, oddly enough, there have been 'fact check' articles that support both Gandhi's claims as well as Malviya's backing it up with other tweeted accounts. While this makes it quite difficult to ascertain which version is true, it must be mentioned that the there several Twitter users that have shared extended versions of the clip that Malviya claims is the ""reality"". This clip incidentally, shows officials brandishing sticks at multiple people as they pass. This extended version of the clip makes it impossible to say with certainty that police batons did not touch the farmers.

One of the fact checks, by BoomLive, went a step further, reportedly identifying and contacting the farmer in question to confirm whether he was indeed hit by the batons. ""My arms have turned black and blue where the lathi hit me and there are bruises on my back too,"" the article quotes him as stating.

""Talks will resume at 2 pm on January 4 on the two outstanding issues. The farmer unions should ask the elderly, the women and children to return home owing to the winter conditions,"" said Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar.

The government is still adamant about not repealing the farm laws, said representatives of the farmers' groups. It is also not ready for legally enforced support prices for produce and said a committee can be formed to look into it.

""The minister said as a farmer's son, he can understand the need for a legally enforceable support price. But it is not practicable due to enormous financial implications,"" said Kavita Kuruganti, representative of a farmers' union.

The farmers had gone to the meeting with the idea of flagging alleged frauds committed by traders in Madhya Pradesh. A Rs 2 crore cheque offered to 22 farmers in Harda district of Madhya Pradesh has bounced, said one of the farmers' representatives, giving an instance.

""After new farm laws were implemented in Uttar Pradesh, prices of crops have dropped by 50 per cent. Crops are being bought at below MSP. Paddy is being sold at Rs 800 per quintal. We will raise these issues in the meeting,"" Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait had told reporters.

Union minister Som Prakash, who is part of the three-member team conducting the negotiations, expressed hope earlier that it would be ""decisive meeting"" and the government wants the farmers to ""celebrate New Year at their homes"". Mr Tomar and Mr Goyal had met Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday, shortly after announcing Wednesday's meeting.

Earlier this month, the Supreme Court had ordered that a special committee be formed, insisting that the Centre's negotiations have failed. ""Your negotiation will again fail as they (the farmers) won't agree,"" said the bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.

The farmers have accused the government of benefitting corporates at their expense. They have said they will accept nothing less than a repeal of the contentious farm laws. They also insist on a law that guarantees the Minimum Support Price, for which the government is only ready to give a written assurance.

Negotiations between the government and the farmers seem to have produced no result, and the farmers are determined to scale up their agitation in the coming days. The country seems to be heading toward a serious confrontation between the government and the agitating farmers.

A noteworthy aspect of the negotiations is that many of the proposals put forward now by the government for the consideration of the farmers are issues which were more or less rejected by the government when those Bills were debated in Parliament. The government is reportedly willing to amend these Acts now in order to meet the demands of the farmers. It is another matter that the farmers have rejected these proposals . They have made it clear that they want these laws to be repealed and if necessary, fresh laws to be enacted after discussions with the farmers and other stakeholders.

Dilli Chalo | Farmers ignore Centre’s proposal on agriculture law amendments

A process of refinement

The demand for the repeal of the laws passed by Parliament only recently essentially points to a serious lapse in the management of the legislative work in Parliament. Parliament is the supreme law-making body which has put in place a large machinery of committees to scrutinise the Bills which are brought before it by the government as a part of its legislative programme. Rules of the Houses leave it to the Speaker or the Chairman to refer the Bills to the Standing Committees for a detailed scrutiny thereof. After such scrutiny is completed, the committees send their reports containing their recommendations on improvements to be made in the Bills to the Houses. While undertaking such scrutiny, the committees invite various stakeholders to place their views before them. Only after elaborate consultation do the committees formulate their views and recommendations. Under any circumstances, the Bills which come back to the Houses after the scrutiny by the committees will be in a much better shape in terms of their content.

This is the common experience. That is the reason why the Rules of the Houses provide for reference of the Bills to the committees. Although, technically, the reference to the committees is within the discretion of the Speaker or the Chairman, the intendment of the Rules is that all important Bills should go before the committees for a detailed examination.

However, every Bill which comes before the Houses need not be sent to the committees. For example, some minor Amendment Bills or Bills which do not have any serious ramifications need not be sent to the committees. That is precisely why the Presiding officers have been given the discretion in the matter of reference of Bills to committees. But it does not mean that they can exercise their discretion not to refer to the committee an important Bill which has serious implications for society. Such an action only defeats the purpose of the Rules.

Draughtsman’s creations

Data show that very few Bills are referred to the Parliamentary Committees now. Ministers are generally reluctant to send their Bills to the committees because they are in a hurry to pass them. They often request the Presiding Officers not to refer their Bills to the committees. But the Presiding Officers are required to exercise their independent judgment in the matter and decide the issue. They need to keep in mind the fact that the Bills which the government brings before the Houses often have serious shortcomings. They are in fact draughtsman’s creations. Members of Parliament who know the ground realities better apply their mind and put them in a better shape.

Across history

Improving the pieces of legislation through detailed scrutiny by Parliament through its committees is historically an ancient practice. In fact, the British Parliament has been doing it since the 16th century. The Indian experience of legislative scrutiny of Bills goes back to the post-Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms. It is interesting to note that the Central Legislative Assembly which was the Parliament of British India, had set up three committees: Committee on Petitions relating to Bills, Select Committee of Amendments of standing orders and Select Committee on Bills. Thus, even the colonial Parliament recognised the need and usefulness of parliamentary scrutiny of Bills brought to the House by the government.

Free India’s Parliament established a vast network of committees to undertake scrutiny of various aspects of governance including the Bills. Prior to the formation of Standing Committees, the Indian Parliament used to appoint select committees, joint select committees, etc. for detailed scrutiny of important legislative proposals of the government. With the formation of standing committees, the occasions for appointing select or joint select committees are few.

A cursory look at the Bills sent to the committees in the past would reveal the seriousness shown by both the government and the Opposition in having the Bills scrutinised by the committees. So far as the select committees or joint select committees are concerned, generally, a proposal from the Opposition to set up such a committee is agreed to by the government.

Usually, some informal consultations take place between the government and the Opposition before a consensus is arrived at on the formation of such committees. Old-timers in Parliament are quite familiar with this healthy tradition of consensus making in Parliament.

These Bills were made better

Now for a few examples of Bills scrutinised by Parliamentary Committees in the past may be cited to show that important legislative proposals were usually sent to the committees for detailed examination; this resulted in the improvement of their content. The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Bill was introduced in 1999 in the Lok Sabha and was immediately referred to a joint committee of both Houses. This Bill was meant to develop new varieties of plants and protect the rights of farmers and breeders. The committee completed its work in eight months and made many improvements by way of bringing greater clarity into various terms and concepts.

Similarly, the Seeds Bill, 2004 was referred to the Standing Committee on Agriculture which obtained the views of agricultural research institutions, agricultural universities, national and State seed corporations, private seed companies, scientists, farmers’ organisations, non-governmental organisations and individuals. Through the process of consultation with a wide range of experts and research organisations and farmers, the committee made significant improvements in the Bill; as a result, there was a better law on seeds.

It was the same case with the Companies (Amendment) Bill, the Information Technology Bill, and the Goods and Services Tax Bill, to name a few. The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill which was introduced in the Lok Sabha in 2011, which was referred to the Committee, was again referred to a Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha when it was transmitted to that House after being passed by the Lok Sabha. Thus, this Bill underwent double security by two committees of Parliament. When this Bill went back to the Lok Sabha after being passed by Rajya Sabha — with amendments as suggested by its Select Committee — Sushma Swaraj, then Leader of the Opposition, Lok Sabha, was lavish in her praise of the Chairman, Rajya Sabha for subjecting the Bill to further scrutiny by the Rajya Sabha’s Select Committee and greatly improving the Bill’s content.

Comment | Parliament and its panels

This is only a sample of Bills referred to Parliamentary Committees for detailed study. It is in fact difficult to understand why the Farm Bills — they seek to alter the well-established system of grain trade in major grain growing States and which have left farmers completely shaken — were not sent to the Parliamentary Committee on Agriculture for a detailed study. The Committee is sure to have consulted the farmers apart from other stakeholders and suggested improvements which, perhaps, could have averted the current agitation.

Functioning by consensus

Our Parliamentary Committees have a tradition of working in a non-party manner. The reports of these Committees are based on consensus. It may be a bit difficult for people to believe that the instrumentalities of Parliament could rise above parties. But that is how they function. The systems of Parliament are inclusive. They have the capacity to harmonise contradictions. Despite the adversarial politics playing out in full force in the Houses, the calm atmosphere prevailing in the committee rooms and the purposiveness shown by the members in dealing with issues are a tremendously reassuring factor. To make these systems gradually non-functional and irrelevant is to invite disaster.

At about 3.00 pm on Saturday afternoon, hundreds of vehicles reached the border from Kotputli area of Jaipur rural. The RLP workers have put up a separate pandal on the highway next to the farmers supporting RLP.

“I request the Central government not to play with fire. Any government who has dared to go against the people has been dethroned. Because of this act agriculture mandis will end, why didn’t the government consult the farmers? Because of these laws, land mafias will increase. I don’t understand why the government is not withdrawing the farm laws,” said RLP chief Hanuman Beniwal at the protest site.

He said he was the son of a farmer but the Central government wants to muscle down the farmers’ protest. “This (farmer protest) is the issue of sustenance and pride of farmers and we are standing with them,” he said.

Earlier, RLP chief Hanuman Beniwal had threatened to quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) if the three farm laws were not repealed. But, he did not make any such announcement on Saturday.

On Friday, farmers from Maharashtra had also reached Shajahanpur to lend their support to those protesting farmers against the three farm laws. The farmers had covered a distance of 900 km since Monday, after they undertook their journey from Nashik.

Addressing famers at the protest site in Shahjahanpur, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Joginder Singh said the prime minister doesn’t care for the children of farmers. “He only cares for the children of a few corporates. He does not understand us,” he said.

“BJP is calling us Khalistani and Pakistanis. Shame on them. Each of us are from Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. We have seen bodies of freedom fighters and soldiers who died for the country. Senior judges, officers, people’s representatives, are coming to our protests and telling us that they support us. The regime is crumbling,” Singh said.

National President of Kisan Mahapanchayat, Rampal Jat, said on the lines of the Singhu border protest, the farmers’ movement in Rajasthan has progressed. “Peace is our strength. A large number of farmers have started coming to the border. The march towards Delhi will be held peacefully,” he added.

Due to increasing number of farmers at the border, the traffic jam on the highway has increased and traffic has been diverted to new routes connecting Jaipur and with the national capital. While coming from Jaipur to Shahjahanpur, traffic has been diverted from four places in between. Similarly, vehicles coming from Delhi are diverted from Bawal. Due to this, the pressure of heavy vehicles has increased on the second road leading out from the highway.

Indian agricultural markets are known to be inefficient. A country that is amongst the top three producers of several cereals, pulses and cash crops also witnesses sharp distortions in prices when there are supply disruptions. While the government has worked towards bringing in agricultural reforms, there is dissent from various vested interests as everyone wants the status quo to prevail. Consumers, as a group, get a raw deal here and end up paying higher prices, while farmers get substantially lower prices. The intermediaries, who bring the two together, add costs and margins and increase the price along the way. This needs to change.

Given the limited investments made in agricultural marketing in the physical area, there can be 3-6 intermediaries involved before the consumer gets the product. This is because firstly crops are grown in different states and must be distributed across the country. Second, the farmer sells in the primary mandi that is within vicinity, after which it travels across other mandis before it reaches the retail end. A farmer in Madhya Pradesh sells soybean in Indore, but it must travel to other parts of the state and country to reach the processors. There are costs involved in terms of transport, storage, damage and porterage, among others.

To get a sense of how divergent the prices are, the accompanying table presents wholesale and retail prices of commodities as per Agmarknet (for wholesale prices) and retail prices (Ministry of Agriculture) in Mumbai. The data is taken for October 15 and, admittedly, prices will vary depending on the quantum of arrivals in the mandis. It can be assumed that the price ranges will be maintained most of the time. For wholesale prices, Mumbai or Vashi are considered, while retail prices pertain to Mumbai. These are the modal prices or average prices, and hence can vary across the city on both ends. The numbers are illustrative of these deep distortions, which are a major concern. All commodities for which both the prices are available have been covered.

The difference between the two sets of prices is very high; and while it is 18% for tur dal, it is generally above 30%. For vegetables it is even higher at 45-65%. For pulses it is mixed and is lower for tur where Maharashtra is a major production centre, while it is one-third in case of other pulses. Sugar is relatively lower at 24-25% and touches 30% for gur.

For pulses, having a higher mark-up is understandable as the retailer must buy through the year when the arrivals take place and make it available until the new stock comes the next year. Hence, the cost of carry is very high as it involves storage charges that can be linked to credit which is passed on to the consumer.

However, for horticulture (both fruits and vegetables that are largely perishables as storage at the retail-end is limited and shelf life is usually not more than a day for vegetables and 2-3 days for some fruits), the difference is inexplicable. Besides, with produce coming in daily, there is an incentive for the retailer to dispose of stocks as there is limited space to pile on the fresh produce. Consumers, too, are discerning and would not choose older stock.

Clearly, the passage of goods is through several channels, which add to cost. Even in a place like Mumbai there would be at least one if not two layers of intermediation before reaching the retailer. All this adds to cost, which builds into the margins. Also, given the proportion of damaged goods that have to normally be sold cheaper to lower income groups or lower range restaurants, the headline prices are kept higher to cover this potential loss on 20-30% of the daily produce. If the volume of damage is lowered, prices can also be better aligned.

The implications of such variance in prices are important. First, the consumer ends up paying a substantially higher price than the mandi rate. While mandis insist on higher quantities being purchased (ranging from 20 kg to a quintal to a retailer/intermediary), the escalation on smaller purchases in quantities of 1 kg or less can account for not more than one-third of this variation that is being witnessed. Second, the same gets reflected in WPI and CPI inflation numbers. Food inflation going by the CPI tends to be higher as the price rise is also sharper here than at the wholesale level. Third, this reflects that what we pay in the market is much higher than what the farmer receives.

Fourth, this means this is a lose-lose situation where neither the producer nor the consumer is gaining. While there is admittedly value-addition by intermediaries, the question is whether this class has proliferated in size and importance due to the inefficiencies in the system that have not been addressed over the last seven decades?

The immediate solution is to allow farmers direct access to the consumer so that the gap is narrowed and both the parties gain. This is already being witnessed in Mumbai for some horticulture products and cereals like rice and wheat. This must be scaled up. The second is state governments must work hard to improve agricultural infrastructure. eNAM is a very good concept but access is limited as roads, transport, knowledge of prices, assaying, weighing and grading facilities must be a bundled facility to make the system work.

This is where the recent reform of contract farming as well as sales outside the mandi system open the doors for alternative models of distribution. To make this effective, states must be facilitators or else these reforms will not progress beyond words. It has been witnessed that the large corporates running retail chains do deliver food products at the lowest prices to consumers. This is the efficient way to go.

An idea the Centre must implement is create an index on doing business for farmers. Just like how it is there for industry where various elements go into the ranking, the same can be done for states with respect to agriculture. This will be a way of ensuring states get more aggressive in farm reforms and a competitive environment is created. Parameters used can be the number of intermediaries in the value chain, the distance for the average farmer to the mandi, the availability of price information in the village, facilitation of contract farming, the availability of aggregators, etc. Such an index will throw light on how sincere we are in enhancing efficiency in the agricultural sector.

Dr Pal has received the invitation for talks from the government. Another farm union termed the government’s call for talk as ‘time pass tactics.’

“Government has given us a five-page letter that only describes things that happened in the previous meeting. This is nothing but time-pass tactics. Representatives of various unions will meet today to decide the next step,” Jamhoori Kisan Sabha general secretary Kulwant Singh Sandhu said. Sandhu is among 39 farm leaders who have been copied on the letter from Centre that was addressed to Pal.

Expressing his view on the Centre’s letter, Shiv Kumar Kakka, national president – Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh, said that it clearly indicates that the government is just indulging in formality and does not want to call a meeting. “It is not at all serious to hold the next round of talks with farmers’ union. If this is not the case, it could have categorically mentioned the date and venue just as it did earlier,” Kakka said. He added that Samyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body representing 40 protesting unions, will take a final decision on a response.

At Singhu border, connecting Delhi with Haryana, where thousands of farmers have been protesting for the past 15 days demanding revocation of the three farm laws, every second person can be spotted doing a Facebook live of either a speech being delivered from the stage or the distribution of food at the langar (community kitchen).

Many youngsters from Haryana and Punjab, who have accompanied their families to the protest site, have also created WhatsApp groups to update people back home about the ongoing protest.

Kawaljeet Singh, 28, a farmer from Mohali in Punjab, said he keeps his selfie stick handy for regular Facebook lives.

“You can’t hold the smartphone for so long and a selfie stick helps get a wider shot. I do at least five to six Facebook live sessions, of 30 minutes each, every day. It’s very important to show people what’s happening here. Otherwise, there is so much misinformation about the farmers’ protests on social media. We are not Khalistani or terrorists who are trying to disrupt the peace of the nation; we are farmers who work hard to feed the nation and we are here to fight for our rights,” he said.

Standing next to the stage set up at Singhu border, a group of youngsters from Moga was trying to upload some pictures on Instagram on Thursday.

Balwinder Sandhu, 32, said many Instagram accounts have come up in support of farmers in the last few days. “We click pictures of the protest site and upload them as our stories on Instagram by tagging these accounts. They pick up the pictures and post from their official accounts to further spread them,” he said.

By Thursday evening, there were around 972,000 posts with the hashtag #farmersprotest on Instagram. Some of the accounts popularising the movement are ‘farmersprotest’, ‘supportfarmers’, and ‘farmbillprotests’, among others.

Youngsters are also using Twitter to garner more support. Navkiran Natt, 29, a protester at Tikri border and the daughter of a farmer family from Mansa district in Punjab, said farmer leaders made a “conscious decision” to promote the movement on social media.

“Many of our leaders have language limitations. So they send their messages to youngsters associated with the protest and we translate them into multiple languages and then post them on different social networking sites. We have also made several videos in Punjabi instructing people on how to make accounts on Twitter and how to use it,” she said.

Using hashtags such as #farmersprotests, #Istandwithfarmerprotest, and #tractortotwitter, at least 100 tweets were posted per hour on Thursday. “We have many WhatsApp and Twitter groups where we discuss and decide which hashtags to use on a particular day. Many of our Punjabi brothers and sisters living abroad also help us in translating the content,” she said.

Through WhatsApp groups, the protesters said they share videos and pictures with people who could not join the agitation at the Delhi borders.

“We also make regular video calls to show our family members what’s happening here. Their hearts and minds are here with us and the movement. Besides, these WhatsApp groups help keep the spirits high. We send the videos of speeches being delivered here to our fellow villagers to keep them motivated and interested in the movement.

But the IT professional from Punjab”s Ludhiana finds himself here in the month of December, running a Twitter campaign to take on those spreading “fake news and running vilification campaigns” against the ongoing farmers” protest.

The Twitter handle — Tractor2twitr — has garnered 2.5 million impressions from across the globe since November 28.

The farmers” protest at multiple entry points to the national capital began on November 26, driven mainly by the food-growers from Punjab and Haryana.

“I had come to India in October-end to attend to some personal work, but then this (farmers’ protest) happened and I stayed on,” Bhavjit Singh says.

He said his idea was to disseminate authentic information about the protest as a “lot of people have been tweeting, running a vilification campaign against the movement”.

His friend and a volunteer, Jaspreet Singh, says, “Paid and motivated users dominate and encroach upon the Twitter space. Our campaign is an effort to counter them.”

“Farmers don’t know how to operate Twitter. We wanted to connect them to it. We don’t have an IT cell, all tweets are “organic”,” he says.

Also, when the international media want to know what is happening in India, they don’t go to Facebook or WhatsApp, they logon to Twitter to see what is trending, Bhavjit Singh adds.

“When the anti-farmer campaign was at its peak, we thought it was time that the farmers moved from the tractor to Twitter. The name of the handle – tractor2twtr – just came out from nowhere,” he says.

Bhavjit Singh says the Twitter handle is being operated by volunteers from all across the globe. “Everybody is an administrator.”

The posts from the handle receive more than one lakh retweets daily on an average, he claims.

“We have consolidated our power, our presence on Twitter. Now, we are giving those running a vilification campaign a tough fight,” he says.

Farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting at Delhi borders against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020.

They are on a day-long fast on Monday even as the agitation spread to different parts of the country with peasant unions staging demonstrations at district headquarters.

Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

For the fourth consecutive day on Sunday, Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) was in the severe zone with a value of 416, indicating a health hazard to all those who were exposed to such poor air. Crop stubble fires in the northern states contributed to 29% of Delhi’s PM 2.5 load according to estimates by System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.

The PM 2.5 concentrations touched 250 micrograms per cubic metres on Sunday, over four times the national ambient air quality standards and 25 times the World Health Organisation prescribed limit of 10 micrograms per cubic metres.

There were over 4,900 fire points in Punjab on Saturday and over 3,500 on Sunday, according to data with the ministry of earth sciences (MoES). The combination of smoke from crop fires and calm winds led to air quality deteriorating significantly. Farmer leaders said crop fires are likely to continue till November 15, by when harvesting will be completed. One of the reasons for the prolonged stubble fire period in Punjab is the shortage of farm labour who had moved back to their states during the national lockdown for Covid 19 pandemic.

“Fires will continue for a week or so. All the late varieties of paddy are being harvested now. Many parts of the state faced labour shortage this year. Most of the farm labour comes from Bihar and UP. They travelled back home during lockdown. There was a labour shortage during the beginning of harvesting season,” said Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharatiya Kisan Union. Agra, Bhiwadi, Baghpat, Bulandshahr, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and many other parts of northwest India also recorded “severe” air on Sunday.

Scientists said air quality is unlikely to improve in the next two days. “In the morning conditions were smoggy but, in the day, relative humidity is under 75% so what we are seeing is only smoke and pollution. Winds are calm so no dispersal of pollutants is possible. Visibility this afternoon is only 600 metres when normally during this season it should be at least 2,000 metres in the afternoon hours. There is no likelihood of improvement till Diwali. At the most, wind speed can increase up to 8 to 10 kmph,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.

A western disturbance is likely to impact the north western region around Diwali day on November 14, but that may not do much for dispersal of pollutants. “In fact, the wind direction will shift to easterly briefly on November 11 or 12 when wind speed will fall leading to accumulation of pollutants. The western disturbance is only likely to bring rain and snow to the upper reaches of hill states not to the north western plains,” Shrivastava added.

“There is anti-cyclonic wind circulation in the lower levels and subsidence (settling downwards) of air in large parts of northwest India presently. Both are linked to slow winds and accumulation of pollutants. We have been seeing a very large number of crop stubble fire points. The combination of these factors is leading to air quality index (AQI) hovering between very poor and severe categories for the past four days,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre. “The centre of the anticyclonic wind circulation is just south of Delhi today leading to most of the impact being felt here,” he added.

According to the Royal Meteorological Society, under an anticyclone air is descending forming an area of higher pressure at the surface. Because of these stable conditions, cloud formation is inhibited, so the weather is usually settled with only small amounts of cloud cover. This very stable atmosphere leads to accumulation of pollutants, experts said.

“Winds are in a transitional phase. On Monday evening, they may shift to north-easterly direction but there is no likelihood of any improvement in air quality because wind speed is likely to be very low. Air quality may remain severe on Monday also and we also do not expect any significant improvement around Diwali. The fire counts are extremely high, adverse meteorology is leading to AQI spiking to severe category,” said Vijay Soni, scientist, IMD, air quality division.

Ventilation index was only approx. 6000 m2/s on Sunday. The ventilation index is a function of the mixing height and the wind speed and defines the ability of the atmosphere to disperse contaminants. A ventilation index below 2,350 sq metres/second is considered poor. Mixing height is the height at which pollutants mix in the air.

Commission yet to meet

Though the six full-time members of the Commission for Air Quality Management for the National Capital Region (NCR) took charge on Friday, days after the Centre issued an ordinance on October 29 to set up the new centralised agency with sweeping powers to monitor and act against air pollution, the members haven’t met yet. Rules for the functioning of the commission are also yet to be framed.

“The meeting of the commission members is not dependent on framing of rules. The rules for the functioning of the commission will be framed in due course. The commission will meet next week and start its work,” said Ravi Agrawal, special secretary, ministry of environment.

'Breaking down silos and ensuring a more integrated governance process is just as important to performance.'

'It has been a major priority in the last six years, especially in national security,' External Affairs Minister Dr Subrahmanyam Jaishankar points out when delivering the Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture-2020: India and the Post-Covid World.

It is a great privilege to be invited to deliver the Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture this year. An important tradition, one that actually started the year I was born, these lectures have been delivered by a galaxy of eminent leaders, scientists, policy-makers and intellectuals.

I am very aware of the many footsteps that I am following today. That I represent Gujarat in the Rajya Sabha makes me even more conscious of this honour. And as someone seeking to connect my world of diplomacy, to Sardar Patel's record of taking on challenges of national development, I can think of no better subject than to focus on India's response to the world after the Novel Coronavirus.

This pandemic has been the most devastating global event in living memory for most of us. Its cumulative impact, in terms of lives and livelihood lost, is truly hard to quantify. Because we are more developed and inter-connected now, its implications for quality of life have been very profound.

In many ways, the upheaval can be comparable to the devastation caused by a major conflict. Yet, it is also very different in terms of its impact within societies and between nations. How it will change our lifestyle is still an unfolding experience.

What we can clearly see is that at the level of individuals, families, societies or even nations, many prospects have changed significantly. There are, of course, opportunities embedded in this crisis and their realisation will be one test of leadership.

At a collective level, we are still limited by our imagination to fully grasp the complications of an era we have now entered. And it is when contemplating these uncertainties that came upon us so suddenly, that the value of leadership in difficult circumstances is really recognised.

In the history of modern India, few symbolise that more appropriately than Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

Seventy-five years ago, both the world and India were in the midst of a different kind of turbulence, one no less in its seriousness. The Second World War had just ended, comprehensively overturning the global order. New centres of dominance emerged with very different interests and outlook. Forces set into motion, some predating the conflict, eventually ended colonial rule in vast parts of the globe.

At home, of course, the endurance and determination of our pioneering Independence struggle finally prevailed. But it did so at the cost of the Partition of our country, with all its accompanying consequences.

This was the context when Sardar Patel ascended the leadership stage and took on immediate challenges of nation building. He was already recognised as amongst our pre-eminent leaders, admired for his political vision as much as for his organisational skills.

On the assumption of power, he took on the most difficult responsibilities of governance, characteristically setting his personal interests aside. And it is this period of his national leadership that holds the most relevant lessons for us today.

IMAGE: Prime Minister Modi pays tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his 145th birth anniversary, October 31, 2020.

In the popular mind, Sardar Patel is seen as responsible for the accession of Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh. In reality, his contribution was even greater. In fact, these examples -- challenging as they were -- took place on a firm foundation that he had laid through a set of high-stakes and fast-paced negotiations with many other princely states. Because these events happened within India, we tend to think of them as politics rather than diplomacy.

But as V P Menon has so ably chronicled, the exercise involved the toughest negotiations we can imagine. And whether it is in their objective, strategy or tactics, they remain worthy of deep study even today.

Sardar Patel is also rightly associated with refashioning the civil services for independent India. He could do so because his administrative acumen commanded deep respect in both the state machinery that we inherited and the one that was then grafted on it.

At the same time, the Sardar remained very much a man of the people. His ability to harness the energies of the masses to the important issues of the day was legendary. His economic thinking has perhaps got less attention in history than it deserves. He clearly recognised the importance of rapidly building national capabilities by promoting greater entrepreneurship.

When it comes to national security, of course, he was undoubtedly the most hard-headed and practical. Distracted neither by political romanticism nor theoretical constructs, he saw the world for what it was, and strategised accordingly.

We also know that he was prescient about challenges beyond our borders. His famous exchange with Pandit Nehru in November 1950 set out their contrasting world views. As he helped steer India through challenges fundamental to our national consolidation, the Sardar set out some basic approaches that are relevant even today. These can serve as an inspiration when we address the issues arising from an extraordinary pandemic.

Even before COVID-19 engulfed the world, it was apparent that the international system we had got used to was under great stress. Its causes were multiple and complex, and they enhanced each other.

A set of issues centred around disenchantment with a globalisation that created unequal gains within societies and among them.

Looking back, it is evident that the economic interests of a few prevailed at the expense of the livelihood of many. The rationale of collective global advancement gradually lost credibility as a consequence.

The resulting class wars in the developed world contributed to growing political insecurity in many cases.

A second phenomenon, one more extended in its time frame, was the rebalancing of the global economy and thereafter, of world politics.

It was inevitable once independent nations emerged that there would be new centres of production and consumption. Its unfolding may have its own complexity that depended on national policy choices. But the larger trend was, in many ways, unstoppable.

After all, no era in history can be frozen to the perpetual advantage of the temporarily ascendant. Yet, when this happened, it unleashed a range of competitions and frictions that characterise current international affairs.

The combination of these two created a third set of challenges for the established global architecture -- a radical change in the weightage of world powers, along with an accompanying behavioural shift of dominant ones.

In particular, the rise of China and the repositioning of the United States have deep relevance. As interests and models became more difficult to reconcile, the resulting frictions brought into the open issues that were dormant till then in the international discourse.

To add to all these is a transformation of the metrics of power in an era of higher technology reliance and greater inter-dependence.

Political influence became less dependent on raw military strength and increasingly shifted to utilising instruments like finance, trade, connectivity, data and technology. The cumulative effect of these multiple happenings is visible today in more players, contested rules, conflicting agendas and sharper disputes.

The COVID-19 pandemic could well be the last straw on the back of a fraying global consensus.

If the world carried the burden of pre-existing conditions even as it was hit by the pandemic, India was no exception.

The conventional narrative in that regard tends to focus on issues of finance and trade, with some social and political problems added for good measure.

But a truly self-critical assessment of the last quarter century would raise deeper questions about our very understanding of reform and globalisation. It is often said that in India, we do the changes we must, rather than the changes we should.

In other words, we react to the crisis of the moment and slip back into a default position of complacency once that appears addressed. And the truth is that this is pretty much what has happened to us since the early 1990s.

Debates on reform have focussed largely around different aspects of the economy, industry and commerce, perhaps natural if we recall that the triggering crisis was a balance of payments one.

But the undeniable reality is that large swathes of economic, social and human activity were left untouched. Whether it was agriculture or labour, education or administration, the power of vested interests kept the impulses of further reform well at bay.

Our human development indices then naturally did not improve. And requirements of urbanisation remained as ineffectively addressed, as the demands of rural growth.

Not just that, the absence of progress across the social front began to tell increasingly even on the economic one.

This domestic scenario was mirrored by an external strategy that also limited India's competitiveness. In the pursuit of globalisation, we entered into arrangements with short-term calculations.

India imported to consume, trade, and profit rather than to absorb, innovate and produce. The over-leveraging of low cost options from outside obviously eroded domestic manufacturing.

Not coincidentally, despite fairly high economic growth, India's employment challenges also started worsening.

The consequences of this on sustaining demand and promoting production unfolded over time. Quite unconsciously, we began to perceive in the efficiencies of others a solution for our own limitations.

And with that, the cause of reform remained at a level that was comfortable for the order of the day. If self-assessments remained positive, it was because they were based on benchmarking ourselves against our own past, rather than vis-a-vis competitors.

That many others, including in our near proximity, had raced ahead always had explanations. By the second decade of this century, these realities have caught up with us. It has led to a growing realisation that globalization without a strategy is like driving without a destination. And the true yardstick for reform can only be its impact on comprehensive national power.

Policy-makers across the world dealing with the impact of the pandemic are now focussed on economic and social recovery. Nations have made decisions in line with their particular circumstances, many conscious that the real challenges still lie ahead.

Addressing both lives and livelihood has been an overarching concern for all. Expectedly, this is India's primary pre-occupation too at this time.

The pathway to recovery, however, also has steps of resilience that reflect the pandemic experience. These could be in terms of the more direct concerns, as in the health and pharmaceutical sectors.

Or they could be broader, covering domestic manufacturing, distribution and consumption. Perhaps more than we realise, rapidly creating a pandemic response infrastructure and meeting huge socio-economic needs during a crisis has created a new level of expectations.

If the Indian public has shown commendable fortitude and discipline in the face of adversity, it was in no small measure due to leadership and motivation.

Today, however, it is essential to think through strategies that would help put that behind us. But precisely because the pandemic has brought to fore many shortcomings, this is also an opportunity to contemplate deep reforms.

In a sense, a foundation for that has been laid by a set of initiatives since 2014. National campaigns addressed a wide range of challenges that were traditionally excluded from the debate on reform.

They ranged from financial inclusion to digital delivery, both on a mass scale; from power and water for all, to affordable housing; education and toilets for girls to sanitation and cleanliness; urban planning and rural incomes, to accelerating infrastructure building; from digitisation and formalization to skills development; as well as promoting start ups, entrepreneurship and innovation.

The message was of improving human development indices, making basic amenities available, leapfrogging using digital mediums, empowering the aspirational, and expanding opportunities and benefits while strengthening skills.

No less important was making change into the theme of a people's movement. By doing so, it finally put behind us the colonial mindset that the people and the government are two different entities.

This commitment to societal transformation was clearly appreciated by the public at large, as evident in the electoral outcome of 2019.

Today, these experiences have helped lay the groundwork for more sweeping changes that were long awaited.

The recent reforms in agriculture, labour and education are particularly notable, aimed as they are at freeing these sectors from the constraints of an era long gone by. Liberating the farmer from the middleman will obviously have profound implications for agriculture. Similarly, modern labour codes will expand employment and provide for wider benefits.

Educational changes have not only introduced more flexibility but made us more employment friendly. Indeed, when set against the backdrop of massive social welfare programmes and digitally-assisted delivery, it tells us how much more reformist a human-centric approach to governance can be.

Policy reforms, however, require practical support, and that too has been forthcoming in different ways. Manufacturing generally and MSMEs are getting the attention and support now that they have long deserved.

More than the sectors themselves, India appears to be freeing itself from the economic outlook of the period that followed the demise of the Sardar.

There are other areas as well where the winds of change are blowing, not least in the entrenched domains of administration and civil service. It is clear by now that Sardar Patel's vision of creating the best policy outcomes needs refreshing.

A renewed stress on specialisation, performance and delivery is, therefore, particularly welcome.

We must have no illusions that the road to recovery and beyond will be a long and arduous one.

Looking at the horizon, there are lessons from experiences of others that India needs to imbibe, whether in terms of human resources, social infrastructure or economic capabilities.

Basic amenities of power, water and housing can no longer be treated as a luxury. Nor can education, healthcare, skills and employment remain just options for some.

In particular, a greater focus on technology and manufacturing is central to India's prospects. Digitisation could well hold the key to the credible emergence of social welfare in a nation with limited resources. This is important to recognize given the growing expectations of aspirational thinking.

A commitment to promoting more employment-centric growth may be assisted by labour reforms and skilling programmes. But, it also sees a strong and sustained effort towards making it easier to do business.

Paradoxically, it has to overcome an earlier encumbering of the economy in the name of being pro-poor, when the reality was that it shrank employment opportunities.

Some of the answers also lie in the purview of our trade policies that have not done our interests adequate justice.

Let us not forget that in a world where trade wars and technology battles are likely to be more commonplace, de-industrialisation is truly akin to unilateral disarmament. But making it easier to do business is not just an economic objective; it has enormous social and even strategic implications.

In the final analysis, it is central to the rapid strengthening of India's comprehensive national power. And where reform itself is concerned, India would truly arrive when we internalise that this is an endless process with ever-widening application.

Serious powers know that this journey really does not have a destination.

Challenges for national growth and development are not limited to the socio-economic domains. Addressing governance deficits and implementation shortcomings are a major part of the solution.

The problem, of course, comes in many forms and variations. They range from outdated policies and inadequate frameworks to casual implementation or even downright neglect.

At the end of the day, it is as much about capabilities as it is about strategising. If we bemoan the limitations of border infrastructure today, we must ask ourselves the reasons for their current state.

After all, the periphery will reflect in large measure the capabilities, or their lack, in the heartland. Leaving parts of the country under-developed or under-governed has its obvious risks, more so at the border.

It also cannot be that we rise to special challenges, while neglecting the daily routine. Safeguarding borders, for example, is a 24x7 exercise, not only an appropriate response to an emerging situation.

Our own debates in regard to national security need to recognise this value of putting in place the requisite structures and systems. Advocating sweeping solutions without laying the groundwork may be dramatic politics; it is not serious policy.

On the contrary, our experience in the last few years in expediting the creation of border infrastructure in the North shows how much difference sharper focus and better implementation can make.

Breaking down silos and ensuring a more integrated governance process is just as important to performance. It has been a major priority in the last six years, especially in national security.

This shift from declarations to delivery is very much in keeping with the outlook of the Sardar. Underlying it is, of course, a basic willingness to fully recognise the challenges that the nation faces.

By playing down issues like cross-border terrorism or competitive geopolitics, there has been a tendency to look away from the hard choices.

In a more difficult world, that is going to be less possible.",news,"But as V P Menon has so ably chronicled, the exercise involved the toughest negotiations we can imagine.

PUNE: The supply of marigolds in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Pune has been erratic due to heavy rainfall over the last few days. The short supply could lead to higher prices for the flowers during Dasara celebrations.APMC officials said that they usually record the arrival of over 60,000kg marigold on an average every day when Dasara is around the corner.This year, especially in the last two days, they have received a lot of damaged flowers due to rain.The officials added that, on October 19, 71,000kg marigold was brought to the APMC, while the very next day it was only 26,000kg. The average wholesale price for marigolds at Pune APMC on Thursday was Rs40, per kg, while the arrival was 45,000kg.The officials said that if damaged flowers continue to arrive in the market, the price of marigolds will rise due to the dip in the supply.Sagar Bhosale, coordinator at the flower market association in Pune, said that everyone is unsure about the supply and demand in the market this year. “From the last few days, damaged flowers fetched a price of around Rs5-10, per kg, in the wholesale market, while good quality marigolds were priced at Rs50-70, per kg. The price of the flowers for Dasara will be decided on the basis of arrival from Thursday night,” Bhosale said, adding that it is very difficult to assess the current situation.If the rainfall does not stop, the produce is expected to get damaged, reducing the quality and price. “Considering that temples are still closed and major companies are not working at full strength, the demand may take a hit this year,” Bhosale added.Babaji Ghadge, a farmer from Rajgurunagar , said that his marigold produce was wasted due to the rains. “I was expecting at least 2 tonne marigold harvest this year but the rain spoiled everything. I have only 10% flowers that can fetch a better price. I have suffered a heavy loss this year,” he said.He added that considering the current situation, good quality marigold flowers could fetch more than Rs100 per kg in the retail market.

Next Round of Talks With Farmers on Dec 5, Govt Says Looking Into Concerns Regarding Weakening of Mandis

Next Round of Talks With Farmers on Dec 5, Govt Says Looking Into Concerns Regarding Weakening of Mandis

On its part, the government assured the group of nearly 40 farmer leaders that all their valid concerns would be addressed, but the other side flagged several loopholes and deficiencies in the laws, which they said were passed hastily in September.

केंद्रीय कृषि मंत्री नरेंद्र सिंह तोमर

The Union Ministers and the representatives of thousands of farmers protesting against the farm bills sat for the fourth round of talks at New Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan on Thursday. However, both the government and farmers failed to yield any resolution. According to the reports, the union leaders stuck to their demand for the repeal of new farm laws and even refused the lunch, tea and water offered to them during almost eight-hour-long hectic parleys.

“In the new Act, it has been provided that farmers can take their grievances to SDM court. Farmers’ Unions feel that SDM court is a lower court and they should be allowed to go the court. Govt will consider this demand,” Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said after the meeting.

“People have reservations on MSP (Minimum Support Price). I would like to reiterate that the MSP system will continue and we will assure farmers about it,” Tomar added. On its part, the government assured the group of nearly 40 farmer leaders that all their valid concerns would be addressed, but the other side flagged several loopholes and deficiencies in the laws, which they said were passed hastily in September.

Tomar later told reporters that the next meeting will take place on Saturday at 2 pm.

A government source said the meeting would resume on Saturday as no final outcome could be reached due to paucity of time.

Union leaders, who came out of the meeting venue shouting slogans, said the talks remained deadlocked and some of them threatened to boycott any further meetings if no solution was found at Thursday’s meeting.

“Discussions are over from our side. Our leaders have said they will not attend further meetings if a solution is not given today by the government,” said Pratibha Shinde, AIKSCC (All India Kishan Sangharsh Coordination Committee) working group member and president of Lok Sangharsh Morcha, which represents farmers of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Another farmer leader Kulwant Singh Sandhu said the government made many proposals including on MSP and procurement system, which would be discussed among the farmer organisations on Friday, before the next meeting with the government on Saturday.

Sources said the government gave a detailed presentation on the three new laws and asserted its intent towards the welfare of the farmers.

However, the union leaders rejected the government’s position at their fourth round of talks with three Union ministers at Vigyan Bhawan here. Besides Tomar, the government side included Railways and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is also an MP from Punjab.

The 40 farmer leaders present at the meeting refused the lunch offered by the government and preferred to eat the food ferried in a van from the Singhu border, where thousands of their colleagues are sitting in protest against the new agri laws.

They also did not accept tea and water offered to them during the meeting, which began around mid-day.

The previous round of talks had taken place on December 1, but had ended in a stalemate even after three hours of discussion as farmers’ groups rejected the government’s suggestion of a new committee to look into issues raised by farmers protesting against the new laws.

The government had rejected the demand for repealing the laws and asked the farmers’ bodies to identify specific issues related to the newly enacted Acts and submit those by December 2 for consideration and discussion on Thursday.

Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector.

On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the new farm laws as they threatened to block roads in Delhi and “take more steps” if it failed to do so.

During their marathon meeting on Thursday, farmers’ leaders told the government to focus on resolving the issues instead of trying to be a good host by offering lunch, Shinde said.

“How can we have lunch offered by the government when our fellow farmers are sitting on roads,” said Shinde, whose organisation is among the 40 farmers’ groups engaged in the talks.

Thousands of farmers have been camping at the Singhu and Tikri borders of the national capital for the last eight days as part of their protest against the laws.

New Delhi: As ongoing agitation in and around Delhi entered the 27th day on Tuesday, farmers blocked the Ghazipur border (Uttar Pradesh) with tractors to protest against the three contentious farm laws passed by the Centre in September. The traffic from Delhi towards Ghazipur and Ghaziabad on Delhi-Meerut Expressway was affected as both side carriageways were closed.

“Traffic diverted from Nizammudin Khattha, Akshardham & Ghazipur Chowk for onward journey via Anand Vihar, Apsara, Bhopra, DND,” said Additional CP Traffic, Outer Range, Delhi.

A group of 10 farmers protesting at Ghaziabad border also started the relay hunger strike on Monday as part of the protest organised by farmer leaders in the national capital. They will be replaced by another group today.

Meanwhile, efforts are underway by the unions to draw support from farmers in other states like Bihar for their demand to enact a law ensuring Minimum Support Price (MSP) as the protest at the border points have been going on for almost four weeks now.

The sixth round of talks on December 9 was cancelled following a deadlock as agitators refused to budge from their demand for repealing the three laws. However, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar invited farmer leaders for another meeting on a date of their choosing.

New Delhi: In an open letter to farmers on Thursday, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar , while pointing to the “politics behind the agitation”, assured that the mandi system and minimum support price would continue as earlier.Tomar urged the protesting farmers to stay away from the rumours and misinformation being spread by the motivated groups.“It’s the duty of our government to remove all your apprehensions and fears. We have always been doing this and will do it in the future too. You trust us. These reforms will lay the foundation of a new chapter in Indian agriculture and make our farmers more empowered and independent,” he stated in the letter written in Hindi, which will be circulated in regional languages too. Later, PM Modi urged protesting farmers to read the letter.In the eight-page letter, Tomar also targeted Congress and other political parties, including AAP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), for “spreading white lies to mislead farmers”. “How can Congress, which sat upon the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee report for eight years, be a well-wisher of farmers. The agriculture minister of UPA, who used to write letters in support of these reforms, has taken a U-turn,” Tomar said, adding AAP and SAD have changed their stand after advocating free market for farmers.Hinting at the involvement of the ultra-left and Maoists in the agitation, Tomar said “a few fringe elements have become part of the agitation and are talking the language which they had spoken during the 1962 war with China”.“The ideologies of such people, who are misleading our farmers from behind the scene, had not been with our country during the 1962 war too. Amid security challenges at the Leh-Ladakh border, people stopping trains carrying grain and other important goods for our armed forces can’t be farmers,” Tomar said.In an indirect reference to the boycott call for products of Reliance and Adani groups by farmers, Tomar said: “When the country is progressing with resolution of Atmanirbhar Bharat and ‘Vocal for Local’, we should understand the intention of these people who are calling for boycott of ‘Made in India’ products.”He said most of the farmers are happy with the three new farm laws. “Being the agriculture minister it’s my duty to remove all doubts and falsehood which are being created in Delhi and surrounding areas,” he wrote.",news,"We have always been doing this and will do it in the future too.

It is ironical that the homage assemblies coincided with one of the most impactful bandhs ever carried out in the history of Punjab on September 25th.The present wave is literally writing a new chapter in the history of Punjab. The atmosphere was reminiscent of lightning engulfing every area comprising every part of the society. What was remarkable was how every section of the society was galvanised to the optimum be it peasants, agricultural labourers, teachers, students, youth, women or industrial workers. The scene in the Malwa belt was similar to an army waging a war with people’s wrath at its zenith. This region comprised districts like Sangrur, Faridkot, Bathinda ,Patiala, Ludhiana, Malout, Mansa and Muktsar The rulers were struck at their very chord. Rarely have people in Punjab brimmed with such confidence as here. The-unity of so many revolutionary and progressive streams was also heartening. An adjective is hard to find to do complete justice to the intensity of the protestors whether obstructing the traffic or blocking the rail roads. The event was in striking contrast to the practice of the ruling class parties like Akali Dal or Aam Admi Party who also condemned the bills. All the 31 participating groups exposed the nefarious nature of the opposition parties and pledged not to have any truck with them. In Gaggarpur village of Bhawanigarh region the BKU(Ugrahan) literally took the rulers to ransom.

The struggle blended the planning of an architect with the fury of a boxer and the craft of a surgeon. What has come to light is how imperialism has penetrated every sphere of society. and semi-feudal opression in agriculture is determined by it. Articulate planning has been done to chalk out protest areas by participants. The most remarkable feature was the implementation of the mass line in taking democratic fervour to simmer at its boiling point with the very core of the soul touched of every person.

The most notable participants comprised the BKU(Ugrahan),BKU(Dakaunda),Kirti Kisan Union, BKU(Krantikari)Kisan Sangharsh Commitee, Thermal Workers Union, Democratic Teachers Front, Naujwan Bharat Sabha ,Punjab Students Union ,motormen services Union in addition to several other fronts like Lawyers organizations, intellectuals, writers etc.

In Khatkar Kalan the Punjab Students Union and the Naujwan Bharat Sabha mobilised around 2000 youth and students in a rally and conference on 28th September. Thousands of youths took a pledge on the occasion of Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s birthday.

1) The ongoing scheme against agricultural bills will be taken full loudly until the bills are returned.

2) BJP and R in Punjab. Ace. The offices of the A.S. and the homes of the leaders will be surrounded.

3) Ambani and Adani companies will be boycotted. JIO sims will be shut down and reliance pumps will be boycotted.

4) Shaheed Bhagat Singh and his colleagues will make a museum and library by leaving illegal occupation at a secret place located in Ferozepur.

The Punjab Radical students union held a film show educating the youth about the relevance of Bhagat Singh in context of saffron fascism prevailing today.

Commemorating Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s birthday, The Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) garnered the maximum forces creating the crescendo of an inferno at Longowal in Sangrur.15000 persons were mobilized, including around 11000 youth. Rallies were also organized in Buttar (Moga), Jaito (Faridkot), Ber Kalan (Ludhiana) and Mattenangal (Amritsar)The speakers touched all the burning issues of the day. There was tremendous participation of Women which was heartening. At the very core the anti-people essence of the agricultural bills was summed up connecting it to the offensive of globalization as a whole and ascendancy of Hindutva fascism. In particular the policies of Narendra Modi were attacked. The speakers adopted the language of the common people in the manner Bhagat Singh did and made a perfect liason between the policies and the day to day lives of the masses.BKU(Ugrahan) secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan said that over ten thousand farmers, including a large number of women and thousands of youth, joined the gathering.

The main speakers addressing the gatherings included young boys and girls in addition to state president Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Vice President Jaswinder Singh Longowal, Harinder Kaur Bindu, Rajwinder Singh Ramnagar and district level leaders. They advised the youth to emulate Shaheed Bhagat Singh’s farmer labour-friendly revolutionary thinking. It was highlighted how Corona was used as a false pretext to block people’s struggles. A massive rail roko has been called for October 1st by all 31 organizations. The speakers invited the people to garner or channelize their justified anger. They alleged that the new offensive was an attack by Modi government to give an open licence to corporates for blindly looting in farming sector. The Modi government was patronising the loot of the Adanis and Ambanis. The leaders devised a strategy to confront the enemy at it’s very core. A plan was formulated to mobilise farming community to gherao the warehouse of Adani Group where grains are stored as well as the malls and petrol pumps of Ambani group. The speakers elaborated how such protests would confront the corporates at their very backbone and send shivers down their spines. Leaders said that the Adani Group has built large warehouse to buy grains and store them in Punjab. The laws passed would be a virtual passport to loot the grain of the farmers. Instead of distributing grains to poor families, they have to be sent to countries and abroad for big profits. The message will be rendered by the surrounding of agricultural warehouses. Farm labourers and other poor families would also show their true metal by participating in these surrounding actions. The struggle will be taken to the next stage by the surrounding businesses of big capital businesses like toll plazas, multi-company shopping malls like Wal-Mart’s Best Price etc and Pepsico. The current agitational phase will be dedicated as a protest week from today’s birth anniversary of Shaheed Bhagat Singh to the cruel day of the Moga Goli incident created by the Congress government on 5 October 1972 They invited people to join in these surrounding actions. The people were guided not to resort to any anarchy as well as maintain strict discipline and guard against enemies.

‘Manipulated media’ was among top 20 India trends

Times View Given the scourge of fake news and doctored images/videos on social media — a lot of which serves to stoke the fires of hatred and intolerance — this initiative of Twitter was overdue. But it needs to be even-handed, and above political and ideological bias in calling out offenders.

NEW DELHI: In a first for India, Twitter has tagged a tweet by BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya as “manipulated media”. The tweet, dated November 28, was related to the ongoing farmers’ protests in NCR. Malviya, while “countering” Rahul Gandhi ’s tweet about police brutality against farmers, had tweeted a video to allegedly incorrectly claim that farmers were not beaten up, but just “threatened”.According to Twitter, it applies this label to tweets that “result in confusion or misunderstanding or suggests a deliberate intent to deceive people about the nature or origin of the content, for example by falsely claiming that it depicts reality”. Twitter uses its own technology or receives reports through partnerships with third parties to determine and tag “manipulated media”, it said.“The referenced tweet was labeled based on our synthetic and manipulated media policy,” a Twitter spokesperson told TOI on Wednesday.The company came up with the policy in February 2020 and used it in the run-up to the recent US presidential elections, including on Donald Trump ’s tweets.“This is not the first time a politician has used manipulated media to spread misinformation. It’s quite common in Indian because politicians are not held accountable for their online posts. This marks the beginning of a change,” said digital rights activist and Medianama’s Nikhil Pahwa.Till the time of going to press, Malviya hadn’t posted any reaction on his handle.The microblogging platform says it applies such tags to any photo, audio or video “that have been deceptively altered or fabricated” to “mislead” people. “Manipulated media” was one of the top 20 trends in India on Tuesday morning.Rahul Gandhi, while tweeting a picture of a farmer being beaten up by a man in a paramilitary uniform, had written, “This is an extremely unfortunate photo. Our slogan used to be ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’. But today, the Prime Minister’s arrogance has made jawans stand against farmers.”Malviya had quoted the Congress leader’s tweet and countered with a clip with two parallel videos titled “propaganda and reality”. The 15-second-long video claimed that the security personnel did not even “touch farmer”. “Rahul Gandhi must be the most discredited opposition leader India has seen in a long long time,” Malviya wrote. His post had received over 7,000 retweets.",india,"But it needs to be even-handed, and above political and ideological bias in calling out offenders.

‘Eaten Canteen Food?’ Twitter’s New Meme ‘What’s in The Vaccine’ is a Dig at Covid Skeptics

as vaccines are finally starting to be circulated, some skeptics aren’t still sure whether they should take it. This may be a result of the newness of the vaccine, there’s no long-term survey and proof it is 100% full-proof, only clinical trials to go by it. Some people, however, only believe in misinformation and want to know the exact components of ‘what’s in the vaccine,’ and this fueled by the anti-vaxxers movement only gets worse. Twitter, however, has collectively started a new meme on why you don’t have to worry about “what’s in the vaccine” if you’ve taken part in several social situations before without hesitation.

Sharma alleged that all the three laws will spell doom for farmers and is a conspiracy to end agriculture produce markets. “Modi government wants farmers to become puppets in the hands of the industrialists,” he added.

With a noose tied around his neck, a 40-year-old farmer enacted a “symbolic suicide” on Friday as peasants from various districts of western Uttar Pradesh protesting the Centre's new farm laws continued their demonstrations in Noida.

Bir Singh Yadav, from Bahlolpur village in Noida, enacted the “symbolic suicide” at the Dalit Prerna Sthal where he has been camping along with scores of protestors belonging to the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti).

Separately, scores of protestors under BKU (Bhanu) continued their sit-in protest at the Chilla border, leading to partial closure of the Noida-Delhi Link Road, according to Noida Traffic Police officials.

“The road is closed for Noida to Delhi movement but open for Delhi to Noida movement. Other key routes like DND and Kalindi Kunj which connect Delhi and Noida are open,” an official said.

BKU (Lok Shakti) spokesperson Shailesh Kumar Giri said with the ‘symbolic suicide’ the farmers' union has once again appealed to the central government to repeal the three new farm laws.

“These are anti-farmer, black laws,” Giri said.

Scores of protestors hailing chiefly from Noida, Greater Noida, Bulandshahr, Aligarh and Muzaffarnagar are staying put at the Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 2. Similarly, several protestors belonging to various districts in western UP are camping at the Chilla border since December 1.

The protestors who have gathered at the Noida border want to proceed to Delhi to join the bigger stir called by farmers from Punjab and Haryana.

Thousands of farmers are currently staying put at Delhi's borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in protest against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

They have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the ""mercy"" of big corporations.

However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.

Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday said the government was hopeful of resolving farmers' agitation against three new farm laws before the new year and was continuing its informal dialogue with various groups to defuse the crisis, amid formal talks remaining deadlocked with the protesting unions refusing to accept anything less than the repeal of the Acts.",news,"This article was first published 3 years agoWith a noose tied around his neck, a 40-year-old farmer enacted a “symbolic suicide” on Friday as peasants from various districts of western Uttar Pradesh protesting the Centre's new farm laws continued their demonstrations in Noida.

In Solidarity: Kerala Farmers Send 16 Tonnes of Pineapples to Protesting Peasants in Delhi

In Solidarity: Kerala Farmers Send 16 Tonnes of Pineapples to Protesting Peasants in Delhi

The cost of the fruit, as well as the expenditure on transport, will be borne by the Pineapple Farmers Association

Expressing solidarity with farmers agitating at the borders of Delhi against the new farm laws, a farmers association in Kerala has sent 16 tonnes of pineapples by truck to the national capital for free distribution. The cost of the fruit, as well as the expenditure on transport, will be borne by the Pineapple Farmers Association, its leader James Thottumaryil said here on Sunday. The consignment from Vazhakulam, known as “pineapple city,” was flagged off by Agriculture Minister V S Sunil Kumar on Thursday night.

It is expected to reach Delhi on Monday evening, Thottumariyil said. MPs from Kerala, Dean Kuriakose and K K Ragesh, along with Harbajan Singh of Delhi Gurudwara, will coordinate with the protest leaders for the distribution, Thottumariyil said.

“The agitation by farmers against these laws is the largest of its kind in the nation’s history…. it is our duty to express our solidarity with them as they are fighting for our cause,” he said.

The Minister alleged that retail trade in the country was already under the control of corporates and if something similar were to happen to the farming sector, consumer states like Kerala would suffer.

Thousands of farmers have been camping at three Delhi border points — Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur — for nearly a month, demanding the repeal of the three new farm laws enacted in September, and a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price.

While the government has presented these laws as major reforms aimed at helping farmers, protesting farmer unions have maintained these acts will leave them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the mandi and MSP systems.

New Delhi: Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) President Sukhbir Badal has announced pulling out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), a week after the party MP Harsimrat Badal resigned from the Cabinet in protest of the new agriculture laws.“The NDA government at the Centre which brought such anti-farmer and anti-Punjab bills, we cannot be part of such an NDA. Our entire leadership has decided this today unanimously that we will not be a part of the NDA,” Badal announced on Saturday after a meeting of the party. He said the decision has followed after his meetings with party workers across Punjab.The SAD has been the oldest ally of the BJP with SAD patriarch Prakash Singh Badal being a founding member of the NDA. Both parties had shared power as allies for many years in Punjab.“We should have been asked by the Centre before framing these laws. We wanted farmers interest to be reflected in the bills but the bills were rammed through Parliament without any changes,” Badal said. He said the bills will adversely affect at least 20 lakh farmers and as many agricultural and mandi labourers.The move comes within a week of SAD leader and Rajya Sabha Naresh Gujral telling ET on September 20 that the party would take a call on quitting NDA within a week and had sought feedback from the party cadre across Punjab.The Akali Dal was under severe pressure from farmers, its main voting base, as well as Congress in the state to walk the talk and quit the NDA. Captain Amarinder Singh had been slamming the SAD for the last one week saying the latter was being hypocritical by not quitting the NDA even as Harsimrat Badal had resigned.In a sign of worsening ties between SAD and the BJP, Badal on Friday said Harsimrat’s “resignation bomb” had shaken up Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was hence speaking daily on the farmer bills now. He also said that he was planning a big farmer march in Punjab on October 1 which will “shake the throne of Delhi”.Captain Amarinder Singh termed the Akali decision to quit the NDA “as nothing more than a desperate case of political compulsion for the Badals, who were effectively left with no other option after the BJP’s public criticism of the SAD over the Farm Bills.”“There was no moral high ground involved in this decision of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The Akalis had no choice before them, since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had already made it clear that it held SAD responsible for failing to convince the farmers about the goodness of the Agriculture Bills. The SAD decision to quit NDA was just the culmination of their saga of lies and deception, which eventually led to their being cornered on the issue of the Bills,” said the Chief Minister, adding that Sukhbir Singh Badal was “virtually caught between the devil and the deep sea after his initial unprincipled stand on the Farm Ordinances, followed by the sudden U-turn in the face of farmer protests.”Singh said the Akalis will now find themselves in a bigger political mess, having been left with no place either in Punjab or at the Centre. “They should admit to their deceitful actions as part of the Union Government and should beg the farmers for forgiveness,” the CM said.",news,"Our entire leadership has decided this today unanimously that we will not be a part of the NDA,” Badal announced on Saturday after a meeting of the party.

Farmer leaders on December 3 refused the lunch offered by the government during their meeting with three Union ministers here and preferred to eat the food ferried in a van from the Singhu border, where thousands of their colleagues are sitting in protest against the new agri laws. The fourth-round of talks began around noon amid ongoing protests by farmers seeking repeal of the laws.

During the lunch break, a small van carrying food for around 40 people was seen outside the Vigyan Bhawan, where the meeting is underway.

""Our farmers' representatives did not accept the lunch offered by the government and we arranged it from the Singhu border,"" Lok Sangarsh Morcha president Pratibha Shinde told PTI.

Farmers' leaders told the government to focus on resolving the issues instead of trying to be a good host by offering lunch, she said.

""How can we have lunch offered by the government when our fellow farmers are sitting on roads,"" said Shinde, whose organisation is among the 40 farmers' groups engaged in the talks.

Thousands of farmers have been camping at the Singhu and Tikri borders of the national capital for the last eight days as part of their protest against the laws.

Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Railways, Commerce and Food Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab, are holding talks with the representatives of the farmer groups at the Vigyan Bhawan.

The government said that the meeting started in the afternoon and discussions are being held in a cordial atmosphere.

On December 1, talks between both the sides ended in a stalemate after farmers' groups rejected the government's suggestion of a new committee to look into issues raised by the protesting farmers.

The government had rejected the demand for repealing the laws and asked the farmers' bodies to identify specific issues related to the newly enacted Acts and submit those by December 2 for consideration and discussion on Thursday.

Enacted in September, the laws have been presented by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector by removing middlemen and allowing farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

However, the protesting farmers have been worried that the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price (MSP) and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector.

On Wednesday, agitating farmers demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.",news,"The fourth-round of talks began around noon amid ongoing protests by farmers seeking repeal of the laws.

One such politician is the former Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who has been eyeing for another relaunch after an embarrassing defeat in the General elections 2019. The Gandhi scion recently posted a tweet in support of the farmers protesting against the three agriculture bills and slammed the government regarding the MSP and APMC.

Rahul Gandhi expressed concern for the farmers of the country, who according to him, are facing severe difficulties in the absence of MSP and APMC. Extending his support for the farmers, the Wayanad MP said that it’s his duty to back the farmers of the country.

“The farmers in Bihar are in grave difficult without MSP-APMC and now the Prime Minister had pushed the entire country into an abyss. In such a situation, it is our duty to support the provider (farmers) of the country,” Gandhi tweeted.

बिहार का किसान MSP-APMC के बिना बेहद मुसीबत में है और अब PM ने पूरे देश को इसी कुएँ में धकेल दिया है।



ऐसे में देश के अन्नदाता का साथ देना हमारा कर्तव्य है। pic.twitter.com/Err20Pp0kv — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) December 5, 2020

While Rahul Gandhi emphatically expressed his support for the farmers and railed against the lack of MSP and APMC, the Congress manifesto from 2019 General Assembly elections reveals a diametrically opposite stand of the party when it went to polls last year.

Congress manifesto for General elections 2019 promised abolition of APMC Act

The Congress Manifesto for the 2019 General elections stated that it would abolish the APMC Act altogether. “Congress will repeal the Agriculture Produce MArket Committees Act(APMC) and make agricultural produce—including exports and inter-state trade—free from all restrictions,” the manifesto read.

Congress Manifesto for General Elections 2019(Page 17)

Congress promised for the complete abolition of the APMC Act in its manifesto while the Modi government has not repealed the APMC Act in its entirety. The new laws passed by the current dispensation provides the farmers with an additional avenue to sell their produce besides the state-run mandis. The provisions in the bills exempt transactions done outside the physical premises of APMC (agricultural produce market committee) mandis from any “market fee or cess or levy” imposed by state governments.

Congress manifesto also promised replacing the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 with a new act

Secondly, the Congress manifesto for General elections 2019 also promised to replace the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, by an act that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies. “The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 belongs to the age of controls. Congress promises to replace the Act by an enabling law that can be invoked only in the case of emergencies,” Congress manifesto said.

Congress Manifesto for General Elections 2019(Page 18)

It is worth noting that one of the farm bills passed by the Modi government is The Essential Commodities(Amendment) Act, 2020. With this Act, the Government of India will list certain commodities as essential to regulate their supply and prices only in cases of war, famine, extraordinary price rises, or natural calamities. The commodities that have been deregulated are food items, including cereals, pulses, potato, onion, edible oilseeds, and oils.

The Essential Commodities(Amendment) Bill, 2020, passed by the government is to a large extent what the Congress party promised of bringing in if it was elected to power at the centre in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

However, the Congress party and its foremost leader Rahul Gandhi’s recent stance on the new farm bills passed by the Centre is markedly different from what they had promised in their manifesto 2019 General elections. The Congress party had promised to remove the APMC Act and bring amendments to the Essentials Commodities Act, 1955. The Modi government, on the other hand, has not abolished the APMC Act and has made amendments in the Essentials Commodities Act similar to what Congress has vowed. Yet, the Congress party has been inflaming farmers against the agriculture bills and stoking unrest in the country.

Congress inflaming apprehensions among farmers about the new farm bills

Congress has been actively supporting the farmers’ uprising against the central government. In September, after Congress states brought in laws to negate the farm bills passed by the centre, the Congress invoked Bhagat Singh, whose birth anniversary was being celebrated today, during the protests, and Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh took part in a sit-in at the ancestral village of the freedom fighter.

The protests have been hijacked by Khalistani supporters and leftist activists but still, the Congress has been resolutely backing the agitation. Despite the protesters gloating over the assassination of the former PM Indira Khan and dishing out similar threats to PM Modi, Chief Minister of Punjab Captain Amrinder Singh has been standing in support of the farmers stating that these laws are against their benefits.

If the laws are indeed against the welfare of the farmers, why did the Congress party include them in their manifesto for the 2019 General elections? Either the Congress party was lying then about repealing the APMC Act and amending the Essentials Commodities Act or it is lying now that the three bills brought by the Modi government are against the farmers. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party should first come clean on what’s their actual stand instead of instigating the farmers against the new farm bills.",2020,"One such politician is the former Congress President Rahul Gandhi, who has been eyeing for another relaunch after an embarrassing defeat in the General elections 2019.

They iterated the demand for a rollback of the laws and said the “deadline” of December 10 set for the government to respond to their demand had passed.“We will block rail tracks if our demands are not met. We will decide on the date and announce it soon,” said Boota Singh, one of the union members. Balbir Singh Rajewal of BKU (Rajewal) said, “If agriculture is a state subject, the Centre doesn’t have the right to make laws on it.”Despite the unions’ unrelenting stance, Tomar sought to strike a conciliatory note and said, “We sent a proposal to farmers on Wednesday. They wanted that the laws be repealed. Our stand is that the government is ready for open-minded discussions... The laws don’t affect APMC ‘mandis’ or minimum support price (MSP).”He said PM Narendra Modi had assured farmers MSP would continue. “We are ready to give this in writing to farmers’ unions and states as well,” he said. Asked how feasible a solution was, he said he was optimistic of finding a way through discussion.Tomar, along with food and consumer affairs minister Piyush Goyal, explained in detail how the government’s proposal would address key concerns raised by farmers — mainly from Punjab and Haryana and some from west UP — who are up in arms over the laws that allow sale of produce outside APMC-regulated ‘mandis’ with protective legal framework, encourage contract farming and set higher bar for imposing stock limits on essential farm commodities.Explaining the farm laws, Tomar said, “The government wants to liberate farmers from the shackles of ‘mandi’ so that they can sell their produce anywhere, to anyone, at their own price, outside the purview of the ‘mandis’. The government has made this law for the whole country and farmers have started getting benefits.” Goyal added.On the issue of penalty provisions for stubble burning in the new ordinance on air quality management in Delhi-NCR, Goyal explained the high penalty provisions were largely meant for industries or industrial pollution.Underlining that the farm laws were reforms, undertaken after many rounds of consultations with stakeholders, both Tomar and Goyal emphasised that the central government was well within its constitutional rights while making laws on agricultural trade. Farmer leaders, however, remained unconvinced of what Tomar and Goyal said in defence of the farm laws and claimed the ministers themselves admitted that the laws were enacted for trade.",articleshow,"We will decide on the date and announce it soon,” said Boota Singh, one of the union members.

In doing so, they are destroying their own futures. And possibly creating a health risk to everybody, including themselves, as potential super-spreaders of Covid-19 in and around Delhi.

It all began with farmers being instigated to head for Delhi to choke its roads and entry points. That was an economic blockage of sorts. Then it became intensely political, as various anti-BJP parties that had earlier advocated the same reforms sought to shoot from the shoulders of Punjab’s farmers to corner the BJP.

A partially genuine concern over the farm reform laws then became a farce. Now, it is sabotage. According to reports in The Times of India, some 1,300 cell towers in Punjab have been damaged or vandalised. These so-called defenders of farmer interests are ensuring that farmers cannot communicate with anyone else. There is no justification whatsoever for protesters to damage the interests of Punjab’s mobile phone users or even businesses who are not parties to the dispute.

Any sensible observer will be sure to ask: how is all this – economic blockade, making things intensely political, and now sabotage – anything to do about farmers?

Quite clearly, those indulging in sabotage want to bring Delhi and the Union government down to its knees, so that they can enforce abject surrender. And various political parties are doing a death dance on the economy for short-term political gains.

As we have repeatedly pointed out, the government has no option but to stay firm in resolve but soft in communication and attitudes. This means allowing the forces of attrition to wear down the resistance of genuine farmers, and then engaging with the reasonable ones to find a solution.

Given the reality that it is the farmers who are rigid and ego-driven and not the government, one way out of the deadlock is for the government to offer two solutions:

One, to promise investment support to all states that are willing to build the marketing and other infrastructure needed to implement the new laws successfully.

Two, promise to conduct a joint study by an expert panel – in which farmers will be included – to understand the medium term impact of the new farm laws on farmer incomes over the next three years. The government can promise to drastically amend the laws (or even scrap them) if the data show that farmers are actually worse off after three years than they are now.

The problem with both assertions – that farmers will benefit from the new laws, or that they will harmed by it – is that neither is fully supported by data and research. However, one thing that helps the government’s case is that no intervention of any kind, from minimum support prices to farm loan waivers to large subsidies on every farm input (power, diesel, fertilisers, seeds, credit), has significantly helped improve the lots of small and marginal farmers, who account for 86 per cent of farm holdings. So, trying something new is the need of the hour. The only dispute is about what that new something ought to be. More of the same failed policies of the past cannot be the answer.

If farmers believe that the case for ending the monopolies of Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis is unproven, the government should offer them a data-based approach to either prove them right or wrong. It is never a mistake to rework policy based on actual, visible outcomes. If the data show that the new laws have not worked to the advantage of farmers, they can be scrapped without any regrets.

But the bottomline is this: no government should accept blackmail and economic sabotage as valid forms of protest. They are not. Short of that, all solutions can be on the table. But the final decision should be based on facts, not fears.",politics,"It is a pity that vested interests masquerading as defenders of farmers’ well-being are damaging India’s nascent economic recovery – an economy laid low by the Covid pandemic.

BJP president JP Nadda said on Thursday that middlemen and not farmers are behind the agitation against farm laws in Punjab while asserting that the Narendra Modi government has freed peasants from the ""slavery"" of selling their produce to predesignated markets and traders.

Addressing a group of farmers from Delhi and nearby villages at the BJP headquarters, Mr Nadda also took a swipe at Rahul Gandhi saying had the Congress leader been a well-wisher of farmers, he would be thanking the prime minister.

He said the three laws enacted by the Centre have many measures that the Congress had promised in its manifesto, adding the prime minister has done what Mr Gandhi had been advocating.

""It is never clear if Rahul Gandhi speaks himself or he is made to speak. Are you a well-wisher of farmers or of the middlemen who only harass peasants,"" Mr Nadda said.

The BJP had organised the programme for farmer representatives to thank PM Modi for the farm reform laws.

The BJP president said there had been many leaders for farmers, but it is PM Modi who took measures to comprehensively change the situation for them by launching many welfare measures since coming to power at the Centre in 2014

He also took a swipe at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for not implementing in her state the Center's scheme to deposit Rs 6,000 into every farmer's account under the ''Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana''.

She has been creating hurdles in farmers' development, but this will not go on for long, he said and stressed that the BJP will come to power in the state next year and implement the scheme.

Assembly polls in West Bengal are due in the first half of the next year.

Lauding the PM Modi government for its pro-farmer measures, he said the Congress only spoke of waiving farmers' loan and that did not amount to more than Rs 54,000-55,000 crore in the 10 years of the UPA rule.

But the BJP-led NDA government has so far deposited over Rs 92,000 crore directly in the bank accounts of over 10 crore farmers, Mr Nadda said, adding that by enacting the three farm reform laws, the PM Modi government has unshackled farmers who can now sell their produce anywhere.

The BJP chief alleged that the opposition parties have been trying to mislead farmers and said PM Modi has worked to implement many measures that he had promised, including paying farmers 1.5 times of their input cost by hiking minimum support price.

Targeting the Congress with a snide remark, he said the party, after tasting defeat in many elections, has ""begun behaving like a street cricket player who would refuse to play after losing his wicket"".

It has nearly been a year to those protests that were held through the cold winter nights, but biryani jibes continue to be made. As latest as in Sepetmber, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind ‘Kejriwal was “feeding Biryani to Shaheen Bagh protesters” during one of his campaign speeches in the capital.

Biryani was almost used as a synonym to imply that the protests were paid and planned to spread disharmony and misinformation over the CAA among the masses.

And now when protesting farmers from Punjab and Haryana are camped at Delhi border, it is a de javu of sorts happening as ‘biryani’ is being served to the protesters. Allegations of the farmer protests being incited by ‘anti-national’ elements and Khalistani ideologue were being made over the past few days. As videos of the protesters being served with a rice dish that looks like biryani are being shared, it has once again come under attack as the ‘anti-national’ food.

People who are against the protests are calling it a repeat of Shaheen Bagh protests, while others are rebuffing the attempts to discredit the protests with biryani debate.

In another attempt to question he credibility of the farmer protests, actor Kangana Ranaut claimed on social media that the 90-year-old Bilkis from Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh protests, better known to the world as “Dadi”, was available for hire to make appearances in protests for “Rs 100”. It all started when images of Bilkis Bano, the Shaheen Bagh protester who was named among Time Magazine’s List of 100 Most Influential People in 2020, started being shared alongside the image of another old woman.

Kangana later deleted the post after backlash on social media.

Meanwhile, a stretch of the national highway at Singhu border turned into a mega kitchen on Friday evening as exhausted farmers camped on the road along with their tractors and cooked dinner following a long day of protest. Even as police permitted them entry into the national capital, the farmers refused to move to Nirankari ground at Burari where they were asked to continue their agitation against Centre’s farm laws.

Some of the protesting farmers claimed that they were waiting for others who were stuck in Haryana. The tractors driven by farmers were loaded with ration and other food items. In the evening, the highway was lit by the warm glow of gas stoves on which they cooked different dishes, like parathas, daal and rajma-rice.

The generosity of the agitating farmers was at display as they served the food to protesters, passersby and anyone else asking for it. They were also carrying milk in large containers which was promptly boiled and consumed with food. After a long day of protest, farmers turned on the music systems onboard some brightly decorated tractor-trolleys and sang and danced along to songs.

FYI: Biryani is a dish of rice cooked with spices and mutton or chicken and is common in Muslim households, prepared on festive occasions. Even though vegetarian variants do exist, biryani enthusiasts deny its existence and prefer to call it pulao.

Singh, who is from Haryana, was addressing a gathering at the state’s border with Delhi at Singhu where hundreds of thousands of farmers have hunkered down, as they protest against the new farm laws. “If the government doesn’t withdraw the black laws, I will return my Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award,” Singh told them.

On Friday, boxers Kaur Singh, Jaipal Singh and Gurbax Singh Sandhu also said they would return their awards if the Centre does not pay heed to the farmers’ demands for a complete repeal of the new laws.

Several other eminent personalities have given similar ultimatums. On December 1, a group of top sportspersons and coaches from Punjab said they will return all their medals and awards and lay siege to Delhi in solidarity with the state’s farmers

“We are the children of farmers and they have been holding peaceful agitation for the past several months,” Olympic hockey player and Arjuna awardee Sajjan Singh Cheema had said. “Not even a single incident of violence took place. But water cannons and teargas shells were used against them when they were going to Delhi. If the turbans of our elders and brothers are tossed, then what will we do with our awards and honour? We do not want such awards and that is why we are returning the same.”

Wrestler and Padma Shri awardee Kartar Singh, Olympic gold medallist hockey player Gurmail Singh, who is also an Arjuna awardee, and former Indian hockey captain Rajbir Kaur also extended their support to the farmers.

On December 3, former Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal returned his Padma Vibhushan award – the second highest civilian honour of the country – to protest the “betrayal of farmers” by the Narendra Modi government. “I feel so poor that I do not have much else to sacrifice to express solidarity with the farmers’ cause,” the 92-year-old had said.

The former president of the Shiromani Akali Dal, which broke off its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party in September over the Centre’s agricultural laws, said that there was no point in holding on to the award if the farmers were “dishonoured”.

‘Don’t take advantage of situation’: BJP’s Sunny Deol

Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party leader and actor Sunny Deol on Sunday claimed the central government had the best interests of farmers in mind, and asked others to not take advantage of the situation by creating problems.

“I request the whole world that it is a matter between our farmers and the government,” he wrote on Twitter. “Do not come between them, because both will find a way after discussions. I know that many people want to take advantage of the situation and are creating problems. They are not thinking of farmers. They may have their own agenda.”

The actor also distanced himself from actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, who had campaigned for him in the 2019 elections and recently joined the farmers’ protests. Sidhu, however, was later barred by farmers from joining their agitation over allegations that he was backing the separatist movement for Khalistan, a separate state for Sikhs.

“Deep Sidhu, who was with me during the election has not been with me for a long time and whatever he is speaking, he is saying on his own,” Deol said. “I am in no way related to his activities. I stand with my party and farmers and will always be with farmers.

Nutmeg with shell is hovering in the range of ₹280-300.

Prices have started moving up on the rising demand from upcountry markets ahead of Diwali season. Nutmeg is a main ingredient in spices, perfume industry besides its medicinal values.

The export market has also been firm especially to China and West Asia for the usage of the product as an ingredient in immunity boosters. Traders felt that the pent-up demand is expected to continue for the time being.

Dwindling production

George Kuruvila, a nutmeg farmer-cum-industrialist in Vaikkom, focusing on value-addition, said lower production has lifted the market in the last few months. The consecutive floods in last two years and the climatic changes have affected the crop in Kerala, a major producer of the spice. The production plunged by 30 per cent last year to 10,000 tonnes.

Monsoon is the peak harvest time for Indian nutmeg, stretching up to August. But labour shortage due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown this year impacted normal harvest resulting in damage and decay and large scale falling of the spice. Hence the output this year is likely to remain flat, he said.

Consumption, imports

According to Anand Kishore, an exporter of nutmeg and mace, the total domestic production of nutmeg and mace (the red membrane) put together is at around 12,000 tonnes of which 30 per cent is empty shell weight and the balance is 8,500 tonnes. Of this, 7,500 tonnes constitute nutmeg; while the rest is mace.

Of the 7,500 tonnes of production, he said 3,500 tonnes goes for domestic consumption leaving 3,000 tonnes for exports and balance as carry forwards. The Indian consumption of mace, mainly used by the pharmaceutical industry, is estimated at 1,500 tonnes. It is priced at ₹1,800 per kg. India also imports mace from Sri Lanka and Indonesia to meet home consumption.

Addressing a press conference on Singhu border on Thursday evening, farmers leader and coordinator of Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh, KV Biju, said, “All farmer unions had a meeting today and we have decided that we will consult four Supreme Court lawyers — Prashant Bhushan, Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves — on the ongoing proceedings in the Supreme Court… We will neither comment on the matter nor announce any decision without consulting these lawyers. We will consult them before taking any decision on whether to implead in the matter or not.”

The Supreme Court had stepped in on Wednesday to try and end the impasse between the farmers’ unions and the Centre over the contentious new laws to open up trade in agriculture, observing that the protests will soon become a national issue and that recent events suggest government negotiations with the unions were “bound to fail again.”

A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Thursday asked the Attorney General of India if the government can commit that the farm laws will not be implemented while the court is hearing the petitions filed against the ongoing protest.

The farmer leaders said that they have not received any notice from the Apex court so far. “We have only got to know what is happening in the Supreme Court through the media. We have not received any notice or communication as of now. We will take a legal decision only after consulting these four lawyers,” said another farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, as the agitation at Delhi’s four key borders – Singhu, Tikri, UP Gate, and Chilla – entered into its 22nd day on Thursday.

Meanwhile, senior advocate and the president of the Supreme Court bar association Dushyant Dave said that he had offered free legal advice to the farmers on all issues. “If they have decided to take my help, it is a privilege and honour for me. After all, for this country ‘Jai Jawaan, Jai Kisan’ means the most. It’s my duty as a lawyer of the Supreme Court to help them as much as I can… I will be happy to appear for them in the Supreme Court if they ask me.”

Senior advocate HS Phoolka also confirmed that the farmer leaders had consulted him and the other three lawyers on the matter. Advocate Prashant Bhushan said that he will be offering legal advice to the farmer associations if they approach him. Advocate Colin Gonsalves said, “The discussion with farmers is in the very initial stage. We might be able to comment on it after a couple of days.”",delhi-news,"The agitating farmer unions at Delhi’s borders on Thursday said that they will consult lawyers on the ongoing proceedings of the Supreme Court —related to their protests against the three farm laws — before taking any decision on whether to “implead” as a party in the matter or not.

KOCHI: Lockdown has been boring for most school students , forcing them to stay at home for more than six months. But for Adwaith K, a high school student from Koyilandy in Kozhikode , the lockdown gave enough time to experiment with his passion for machines and develop a unique one with the aim of helping farmers .The boy has created a multipurpose agricultural machine using an old bike and the machine, powered by solar panels, can be used to cut grass, plough farm land, sow seeds and water them.It also has a mechanism to drive out the machine on its own if the tyres get stuck in the mud while at work.With the video of his machine having gone viral on social media, the boy is getting appreciation from various quarters asking him to develop an advanced model of the machine. Adwaith is the elder son of Rajeev Kodaloor and Jayanthi L, both school teachers, and he studies in Class X at CKG Memorial HSS, Koyilandy.Being passionate about machines since childhood, Adwaith developed the idea of the multipurpose agricultural machine after watching his grandfather, who was a farmer, struggling to plough the land and sow the seeds. He had created a basic model of the machine in 2019 that won him A Grade in the State School Science Fair. However, the machine with all its features and 12V solar panel was completed during the lockdown with the help of his father and his friend Lineesh, an engineer.“It took me around six months to complete the work and put it to test. More than 80% of the machine is made up of scrap material and this includes the Hero Honda Splendor engine which I took from my uncle’s old bike. The frame was welded to accommodate all the features I intended. The bike runs on petrol but all the features work on solar power. The solar power is also stored in a battery and it can be used for functioning of household appliances too,” said Adwaith.The machine has a water tank to sprinkle on newly sowed seeds. After seeds are sown, the machine can cover the pit too. The vehicle can be driven through grass to trim it with an attached grass-cutter. Adwaith said the vehicle can be used where a tractor doesn’t have access. The cost of the machine was around Rs12,000.“My dream is to become an efficient mechanical engineer who focuses on developing machines that could help farmers. Now I am working on making an advanced model of the machine.

Farm Bills: MSP Not ‘Part of Law’ But Will Continue, Says Agriculture Minister, Accuses Oppn of Misleading Farmers

""We have declared MSP for Kharif and Rabi crops. As soon as Kharif crop is harvested, govt procurement will begin,"" Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told news agency ANI.

NS Tomar (Picture: ANI)

New Delhi: Amid criticism that farm bills will do away with the Minimum Support Price (MSP), Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday assured that it will continue, adding that it was not made a mandatory provision in the agriculture bills because it has never been a part of the law.

“We have declared MSP for Kharif and Rabi crops. As soon as Kharif crop is harvested, govt procurement will begin,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told news agency ANI.

Attacking the Congress party, the minister asked the opposition party why it didn’t incorporate the MSP in the law despite being in power for 50 years. “Has MSP ever been part of law? Congress ruled for 50 yrs, why didn’t they incorporate it in law? They’re making issue as they don’t have anything to criticise. MSP has always been Govt of India’s administrative decision & remains so,” he retorted.

“Congress & some opposition parties are misleading farmers for personal gains as they themselves couldn’t bring such reforms. Manmohan Singh & Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar wanted to bring reforms, but due to pressure from some people, UPA couldn’t muster courage,” NS Tomar asserted.

Affirming the proposed agriculture laws, Tomar said that farmer welfare would not have been possible without

it, terming the ordinances as “revolutionary”.

“The welfare we want for farmers wouldn’t have been possible without changing laws. Farmers’ Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Bill, & Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Bill will be revolutionary.”

The opposition and the government are at loggerheads ever since the two farm Bills were passed amid a ruckus in the Upper House on Sunday. The third contentious Bill on essential commodities was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

On Sunday, pandemonium broke out in the Upper House as the opposition protested over the two Farm Bills. Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien even approached the Chair and tried to snatch a mike while citing the rule book.

Among the demands is that this Ordinance promulgated by the Centre to deal with air pollution in Delhi and NCR regions is withdrawn or at-least have its provisions watered down.

The Ordinance was promulgated in October through which a Commission on Air Quality Management is being set up in Delhi-NCR region.

The Commission will be headed by a secretary-rank official and have jurisdiction over NCR, including areas in Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan with regard to air pollution.

As per the Ordinance, the Commission will supersede all other bodies/authorities set up through judicial orders or otherwise on air quality management, and in case of a conflict between orders of the Commission and those issued by state governments, the Commission's orders will prevail.

The Commission will also replace the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) constituted by the Supreme Court more than two decades ago.

The Ordinance also has provisions of jail term up to five years and penalty up to Rs 1 crore or both in case of non-compliance of the orders or directions issued by the Commission.

The Ordinance was promulgated as part of the Union government’s assurance to the Supreme Court to tackle air pollution in and around Delhi during October-November due to burning of stubble by farmers in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi.

In view of this, the Supreme Court kept in abeyance its decision to appoint a one-man Commission headed by retired justice Madan B Lokur.

Supreme Court Chief Justice Sharad Bobde said that the apex court will look into the provisions of the Ordinance.

Protesting farmers during their second meeting with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar yesterday (3 December) expressed concerns over the penal provisions.

“The government is open to considering and discussing these issues as well,” the minister said.

Punjab alone had accounted for about 75,000 cases of stubble burning this year, while Uttar Pradesh and Haryana made up for nearly 7,500 cases.

Media reports said that the government has offered to make eight changes in the laws during the talks yesterday, that were inconclusive. Farmers’ representatives will meet Tomar, Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and his deputy Som Prakash again tomorrow to end the deadlock caused by the blockade on Delhi borders.

The Modi government had, during the Monsoon session of Parliament, passed the The Farmers produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, to usher in agricultural reforms.

The Trade and Commerce Act allows farmers to sell their produce to anyone, anywhere in the country, while the Price Assurance Act facilitates contract farming with the agreement written in the language the farmer understands.

The Essential Commodities Act amendment removes all stock limits for traders and will help farmers to sell their producers to buyers without worrying about the cap.",news-brief,"The Ordinance was promulgated in October through which a Commission on Air Quality Management is being set up in Delhi-NCR region.

These claims appear somewhat ironic as farmers have been on a prolonged protest against the newly announced farm laws. That agriculture would lead the revival of the Indian economy out of the pandemic-induced economic slump is the optimistic official claim.

Nothing could be further from the truth. For a start, it is an utterly false notion that a good harvest automatically translates into “good” profits from farming. To make farming a profitable enterprise, we need to factor in two more variables along with higher production, namely the cost of cultivation and the price of the produce, and thus income and profit, that the peasant actually realises from the sale of his harvest.

It is true that kharif 2020 was marked by an expansion in the area sown; this would obviously lead to a higher production compared with the last season. The area under kharif crops in 2020-21 was 1,104.54 lakh hectares, an increase of 5.7 per cent over 2019-20 (as per the latest official statement released on September 11). The higher acreage has been attributed to a good and timely monsoon.

According to the first advance estimate of crop production released by the Ministry of Agriculture on September 22, the production of foodgrains was estimated at 144.52 million tonnes, marginally higher than the 143.38 million tonnes registered in 2019-20. The production of pulses is expected to be 9.3 million tonnes, 20 per cent higher than in 2019-20.

The production of paddy, the main kharif crop, has been estimated at 102.4 million tonnes, marginally higher than the previous year.

Among non-food crops, oilseeds output is estimated at 25.7 million tonnes, about 15 per cent more than the previous year’s figure. The production of cash crops such as sugarcane and cotton is also expected to be higher this year.

FAS survey

Does this across-the board increase in production necessarily translate into higher farm incomes in rural India? A recent survey conducted by the Foundation for Agrarian Studies (FAS) showed that it has not and it presented some important findings in this regard. The recently-constituted Pandemic Studies Unit of the FAS conducted telephonic surveys to study the multifaceted and still unfolding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on life, production, and work in rural India. The survey covered 164 households in 26 villages in 13 States across India. A detailed field note is expected to be published in the forthcoming volume of Review of Agrarian Studies (www.ras.org.in).

The survey, conducted in September and October, sought to identify changes in cropping patterns and the area sown under various crops. It also sought information on access to and the costs of cultivation arising from the use of inputs—seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, irrigation, human labour, machinery, and credit.

Of the total of 164 respondents, 129 belonged to farm households that worked the land for the cultivation of kharif crops. They represented a cross-section of village society—large landlords, rich peasants, poor peasants, agricultural and manual workers and others, including those engaged in non-agricultural activities.

The survey’s major finding was that the higher production of foodgrains did not translate into higher earnings for farmers, irrespective of the class of the peasantry. That is, neither the rich and large landholders nor the small peasants or agricultural workers appeared to have benefited from the expansion of area and the resulting increase in output. What then explains the increase in area and production? It would appear that region-specific factors, combined with a generally good and timely monsoon in most parts of the country, averted a full-blown agrarian slump and contributed to an increase in the production of foodgrains.

What were these region-specific factors? In Bihar, for example, we see a food-and-distress-driven return to farming during the pandemic year. In two villages of northern Bihar where labour out-migration, especially of landless labour, is traditionally high, many migrant workers did not return to the cities for work during the lockdown. Instead, they took small areas of agricultural land on lease for personal cultivation.

In Nayanagar village in Bihar’s Samastipur district, a migrant worker who belongs to the Scheduled Caste informed the survey team that for the first time in his life he took on lease 10 cottahs of land (a cottah in Nayanagar is 0.04 acre) on a shared contract for paddy cultivation, solely for family consumption. In contrast, a capitalist farmer from Tehang village in Punjab’s Doaba region, who owns about 30 acres, said that because of the higher costs of cultivation during the pandemic, he increased the area sown under kharif crops by leasing in another five acres with the objective of enhancing his total income. Both examples suggest the prospects of diminished incomes from the kharif crop. In rain-fed or canal-irrigated villages, the good monsoon resulted in previously fallow or uncultivated lands being sown. For instance, in Palakurichi and Venmani villages in Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam district, where kharif cultivation is entirely dependent on water released from the Mettur dam across the Cauvery, farmers were able to cultivate the “kuruvai” crop (a short-duration paddy crop) for the first time in more than a decade. “This was because the Mettur dam was opened in early June this year,” a rich peasant from Venmani village told the team.

Rising cost of cultivation

The FAS survey also identified the reasons why, despite a good harvest, this year has proved to be a bad one for farmers. Most notably, the survey found a sharp increase in the cost of cultivation during the kharif season across the country, primarily on account of a rise cost of material inputs, machine use and hired labour.

First, the input costs of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. A poor peasant from Ananthavaram village of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh reported that the fertilizer cost per acre for paddy this year was up at Rs.1,300 from Rs.1,150 last year, mainly because of limited availability with the local fertilizer dealer. In the villages of Bihar, a shortage of urea was reported, which resulted in urea prices increasing from Rs.350 for a 46-kilogram bag to Rs.400. Farmers from Hakamawala village in Mansa district of Punjab informed the team that the price of cottonseed had increased during the lockdown period by Rs.50 a packet. The cost of seed per acre had increased from Rs.2,400 to Rs.2,600.

Second, the hike in diesel prices ahead of the kharif season significantly pushed up cultivation costs across the country. The price of diesel in Delhi rose from Rs.69.39 per litre on June 1 to Rs.80.53 on June 30, an increase of 16 per cent. June is normally the busiest period during the kharif season when farmers are engaged in land preparation, irrigation, sowing/transplanting, and spraying, and most of these operations are largely mechanised in most States.

The higher cost of diesel meant that farmers incurred a higher cost right at the beginning of the season. It also disproportionately impacted marginal and small peasants who comprise the bulk of those who hire machines. For instance, the survey revealed that the increase in the cost of hired machines for ploughing ranged from 10 to 70 per cent this year compared to the last kharif season.

Third, during the kharif season, like during the rabi, farmers also faced a shortage of labour. The movement of migrant workers—inter-State, inter-district or intra-district—was severely constrained during the lockdown, not just because of the lack of transport facilities but also by the fear of the virus and the threat of harassment. As a result, the cost of hired labour increased significantly in those villages with a significant dependence on migrant workers for certain operations.

In Tehang village in Punjab, for instance, where the highly labour-intensive paddy transplantation is traditionally performed by migrant workers from Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere, there was a huge shortage this year. As a result, the labour costs for paddy transplantation increased from Rs.3,000 an acre to Rs.5,000, an increase of 67 per cent.

A landlord from Gharsondi village in Madhya Pradesh told the survey team that he arranged his own transport to bring migrant workers from Bihar for paddy transplantation. Villages such as Ananthavaram and Bukkacherla in Andhra Pradesh, Nimshirgaon in Maharashtra, and Panahar in West Bengal, all of which depend on labourers from neighbouring villages or nearby districts, also faced labour shortages, which drove up wages for hired workers this year.

A landlord in Panahar village in West Bengal’s Bankura district said that a group of workers from the western parts of the State who traditionally performed the paddy transplanting and harvesting operations did not arrive this year. This enabled local labourers to increase the piece-rate wages of paddy transplantation from Rs.3,000 an acre to Rs.3,500. Similarly, in Muhuripur village in Tripura, Bangladeshi migrant labourers who usually arrive for the transplanting and harvesting operations stopped coming after March.

Price realisation of kharif crop

Since harvesting operations had not yet commenced when the survey was done, the team could not gather information on the actual price realisation for kharif crops. However, previous village surveys under the FAS’ Project on Agrarian Relations in India (PARI) showed that farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, depend entirely on private merchants to sell their produce, and the realised farm harvest prices were generally far below the officially declared minimum support price (MSP) in most villages. In fact, farmers often sold their produce at prices below the cost of cultivation, actually incurring losses from the farming.

The COVID-19 pandemic added more misery for those engaged in agriculture, who already suffer from the lack of a good marketing system for their produce. A rapid assessment survey conducted by the FAS during the lockdown (April-May, 2020) revealed that the local market channels for the sale of produce had completely collapsed. This implied that the incomes of farmers, especially small peasants, had been gravely impacted. The disruption of supply chains led to a slump in the local farm harvest prices for most agricultural produce.

During this crisis, a higher MSP and higher procurement by the government could have ensured a reasonable income from farming to the large number of small and marginal farmers in the country.

Paddy procurement

The example of paddy, India’s main kharif crop, is illustrative. According to the latest available official data, only 38 per cent of the total national paddy output was procured in 2018-19. In addition, there was a wide variation in procurement across States and much of the procurement benefited Punjab and Haryana. In the three important rice-producing States of West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, state procurement was below 20 per cent of the total production in 2018-19.

In the current kharif season too, according to data from the Food Corporation of India (as of December 7), 75 per cent of total paddy procurement was from Punjab and Haryana. This implies that a majority of the farmers from other States sold their kharif output to private traders at much lower prices.

Data from the government’s Agrimarket revealed that the harvested kharif crops such as paddy, bajra, maize, black gram and soyabean were selling far below the support price in most States.

For instance, on December 8, maize was selling between Rs.1,200 and Rs.1,600 a quintal across States compared to the announced MSP of Rs.2,150. Similarly, bajra was selling at Rs.1,300-1,400 a quintal in Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh, about 37 per cent below the MSP of Rs.2,150.

The market arrivals of most crops after this year’s rabi harvest was also much significantly lower than last year. Market arrivals, of which public procurement is only a part, provide a fuller picture of how incomes may have fared. Agrimarket data revealed that between March and September this year, the market arrivals of all the crops across the country were much lower than in 2019. For wheat, the most important rabi crop in India, market arrivals were only 60 per cent of last year.

In the case of barley, cauliflower, potato, lentil, tomato, cabbage and okra, market arrivals this year were between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of market arrivals in 2019. What the significantly lower market arrivals this year indicate is that a significant proportion of the harvest of farmers did not make it to the regular markets. Ominously, they indicate that the prices realised by Indian peasants this year were significantly lower than last year.

More loans at higher rates

To meet the increasing costs of cultivation, poor peasants and manual workers across villages told the FAS team that they had taken loans to the meet expenses related to agricultural activities in the kharif season. Loans were taken from input shops, moneylenders, local traders, and friends and relatives. The interest rates were obviously very high, ranging from three per cent to six per cent per month, translating to 36-72 per cent a year..

There were instances of farmers being denied formal loans such as Kisan Credit Card loans because they had not repaid their previous loans taken during the lockdown. A poor peasant from Nayanagar village in Bihar reported that he had taken a loan of Rs.16,000 from a merchant and input dealer at 4 per cent a month, or 48 per cent in annualised terms.

Significantly, he said that the interest rate on informal loans had increased to four per cent a month from three per cent mainly because of the greater demand from poor people.

In sum, the survey highlights three main points, which effectively rebut the official narrative that the higher kharif production this year is a sign of agrarian prosperity.

First, in some areas the increase in acreage and output was driven by food and income security in a pandemic year; this by no means implies that all is well with the peasantry. Second, the increase in the cost of inputs such as diesel and labour significantly increased the aggregate cost of cultivation in the kharif season. Lastly, the increase in the MSP between 2019-20 and 2020-19 for kharif crops was paltry in the context of the sharp increase in the cost of cultivation.

The government increased the MSP for paddy by 2.9 per cent, by 4.9 per cent for cotton, by 2-4 per cent for pulses, and by about 5 per cent for oilseeds—much below the increase in the actual cost of cultivation during the kharif season.

It is thus obvious that farmers, especially those with smaller holdings, have been squeezed by rising costs on the one hand and the collapse in output prices owing to tardy procurement on the other, and also because the increase in the MSP was paltry.

Indeed, farm households are not going to benefit from the increased production during this kharif crop. If anything, their incomes might actually be even lower than in the previous year.

The solution to the problem of falling incomes obviously lies in a set of policies that are diametrically opposite to the ones the Union government has chosen to pursue through its recent pieces of legislation. Logically, it would appear that the government needs to regulate input prices, expand and smoothen the channels of access to formal credit, ensure higher procurement prices and guarantee state procurement. Only the pursuit of such a course would have ensured that higher agricultural production results in income gains for vast sections of the Indian peasantry.

The protesters were asking for the withdrawal of changes in the land reforms act - permitting non-agriculturists to buy farm land - and amendments in the APMC Act which now permits farmers to sell their produce to anybody of their choice. They are also demanding that changes made in the Essential Commodities Amendment Bill be withdrawn.

Siddaramaiah speaking at the protest said that the proposed changes were the ‘death knell’ to the farming community. “I challenge the CM to resign and let there be polls on these issues and we will see what the outcome will be,” he said. KPCC president DK Shivakumar demanded that the ‘three black laws’ be withdrawn or repealed. Later, a Congress delegation also submitted a memorandum to the Governor on this issue.

Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa addressing a press conference reiterated that the farm bills passed in the just concluded assembly session were in the interests of the farmers. “As a farmer’s son, I will never do anything against their interests. The Opposition is trying to misguide the farmers and it is a conspiracy. Even now anybody buying irrigated agricultural land cannot use it for any other purpose. They cannot buy land of SC/ST or small farmers.”

Yediyurappa also said that allowing farmers to sell their produce to anybody of their choice rather than only through APMC’s was an “achievement after a 25-30 year struggle”.

Have Come to Delhi For Decisive Battle, Protest to Continue Until Demands Are Met: Farmer Leaders

Addressing a press conference at Singhu border, a representative of protesting farmers said that they want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their ""mann ki baat'.

New Delhi: Farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agri laws at Delhi border points on Monday said they have come to the national capital for a “decisive battle” and asserted that they will continue their agitation until their demands are met.

Addressing a press conference at Singhu border, a representative of protesting farmers said that they want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to listen to their “mann ki baat’.

“Our demands are non-negotiable,” he said and claimed the ruling party “will have to pay a heavy price” if it does not heed to their concerns.

“We have come here to fight a decisive battle,” he said.

Another farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni said that around 31 cases have so far been registered against protestors to “suppress” their agitation.

Chaduni said that farmers will continue their agitation until their demands are met.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground and had said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.

A meeting of over 30 farmer groups on Sunday rejected Shah’s offer for talks before the scheduled date of December 3 and demanded an unconditional dialogue.

Thousands of protesters refused to budge and spent another night in the cold at the Singhu and Tikri border points.

Their representatives had said that Shah’s condition that they shift the protest is not acceptable and claimed Burari ground is an “open jail”.

Social activist Anna Hazare has threatened to go on a hunger strike if his demands on issues concerning farmers are not met by the Union government by the end of January next year, and said it would be his ""last protest"".

Speaking to reporters in his Ralegaon Siddhi village in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra on Sunday, Hazare said had been holding protests for cultivators since the last three years, but the government has done nothing to resolve the issues.

""The government is just giving empty promises due to which I do not have any trust left (in the government)...Let's see, what action the Centre takes on my demands. They have sought time for a month, so I have given them time till January-end. If my demands are not met, I will resume my hunger strike protest. This would be my last protest,"" the 83-year-old said.

On December 14, Hazare wrote a letter to Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar warning of a hunger strike if his demands like the implementation of the MS Swaminathan Committee's recommendations and granting autonomy to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), were not accepted.

Senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagade recently met Hazare to explain to him the details of the three farm laws introduced by the Centre.

Hazare observed a fast on December 8 in support of the Bharat Bandh called by farmer organisations demanding a repeal of the agri laws.

Farmers have been protesting at borders of Delhi for over a month against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

The three farm laws, enacted in September, have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

However, the protesting tillers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.",mumbai,"Anna Hazare threatens to launch his ""last protest"" for farmers | File PhotoSocial activist Anna Hazare has threatened to go on a hunger strike if his demands on issues concerning farmers are not met by the Union government by the end of January next year, and said it would be his ""last protest"".

Logistics companies told Reuters they have seen a surge in demand to bring goods into the country before any potential disruption in January, and customs agents report being overwhelmed by pleas for help from traders navigating new rules for the first time.

“We have told our customers that the best thing you can do now is stock up, stockpile, and they’re bringing in as much as they can,” Jon Swallow, director of Jordon Freight, told Reuters of the changing dynamic in the last two weeks.

“The consequence of that is there’s simply not enough capacity and the prices are going through the roof.”

Swallow said the increased demand had pushed prices up by around 20% in recent weeks and would likely rise further in December.

Fellow freight specialist Tony Shally said his Espace Europe had seen the cost of journeys between Poland and England, and France and England, rise by more than 10%.

The frantic activity reflects the need to get ready for Britain’s departure from the world’s biggest trading bloc which will spark a need for customs and safety declarations, and some checks, when goods move into the European Union after Dec. 31.

Companies had stockpiled goods before previous Brexit deadlines but many are in a weaker financial position now after the pandemic hammered their cash flow.

Among the recent rush to bring in goods, companies are also having to prepare to deal with customs declarations for the first time, putting huge pressure on the small customs sector.

Sam Harris, operations manager at Freight UK, said it had become a full time job just to answer the phone to new customers. “Most know nothing about customs,” he said. “Everyone is panicking.”

“We had a farmer on the phone and he had no idea whatsoever about what needed to be done.”

And why do we need journalists anyway?

I should admit here that these are questions that have bothered me for years. I've always thought of myself as a journalist first and foremost (even in the phases when I wasn't actively reporting or editing the news). But others haven't always seen me that way. Just last year for example, I was startled when a friend described me as a 'digital innovator'.

Ordinarily that would be no reason to write this piece, but these questions are always important. And in the context of our times, they're also urgent and compelling. Just in the last 24 hours for example, Twitter has been trending with #RIP_IndianMedia, with tweets such as this one:

Now we might be forgiven into thinking journalism is about hounding people with a camera and mic, whether it is a delivery person or a Bollywood star. Or we might think journalism is about moralizing from the studio.

The truth is, there are more than a dozen kinds of journalists to be (and the corollary: more than a dozen reasons to read, listen to, and watch journalism).

To avoid any confusion, when I say journalism 'kinds' or 'types', I'm not referring either to:

Sports, business, political, science, legal, entertainment or crime journalists (or any other type).

Or investigative, explanatory, solutions, computational journalists (or any other type).

Instead, I look at it from the perspective of the needs that journalism and journalists should seek to fulfill. Specifically, I cite the work of Stephen J. Ward, a media ethicist. Ward argues that journalists ought to strive towards human dignity in four spheres: individual, social, political, and ethical.

15 roles of journalism



INDIVIDUAL

1. Provide information and analysis about the world

This is basic, and certain TV networks apart, most news organizations do this pretty well. It is also the least a newsroom can do, and when newsrooms struggle to do this well, it's a signal not to trust them.

2. Monitor basic levels of dignity

Whether it is farmers' distress or violations of basic human rights, journalists have a duty to highlight them. Unfortunately, a lot of media organizations have abandoned this rather basic principle. Currently in India, there are farmer agitations. People are being arrested for the flimsiest of reasons. But several news organizations have either ignored the stories or relegated them to the inside pages. Worse, some news organizations have deliberately focused on distractions (such as the ridiculous focus on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the ensuing witch-hunt of other actors).

Question to ponder: Is the arrest of Umar Khalid under UAPA and his demonization proof that his basic human rights have been violated?

3. Investigate inequality

This is similar to the earlier point, but inequalities are not just a question of rights and dignity, but much more. For example, women may have access to all the human rights and dignity in the world, but they still have to negotiate the hidden codes that govern a patriarchal order.

Journalists in other words, not only have to monitor dignity but also expose hidden inequalities.

SOCIAL

4. Report critically on economic associations

The quality of our lives are a result of not just individual rights, but also how we interact as individuals or groups with other groups and individuals.

A journalist then has the duty to report on various aspects of our social lives. This includes asking if society's use of economic power is fair and just. It is also our job to ensure 'fair economic competition'.

Questions to ponder: Do business periodicals and business new channels do this? Or do they focus on narratives dictated by various markets and corporate firms?

5. Assess quality of social life

The standup comedian and thinker Hannah Gadsby was only diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum in her 40s. All her life, she struggled in numerous small and big ways, she says in her Netflix special Douglas. But until she was diagnosed, she didn't have the language to describe it.

It's not just autism. Practically every major gain in our collective history has come about because we were able to name, identify and recognize what was happening to us.

A journalist's job, Stephen J. Ward argues, is to report on ""all the types of social life, social and technological trends, and social possibilities available for citizens. It should inquire into whether such trends nurture caring relationships, meaningful collective activity, and flourishing communities.""

6. Assist social bridging

This is a biggie. We are so polarized that we urgently need journalists to facilitate conversation and understanding between different communities. Ward writes that journalism ""has a duty to act as a bridge between diverse classes, ethnic groups, religions, and cultures within and among countries.""

In India, this would refer to journalists being the bridge among different religions, castes, genders, class, languages, regions, people of various sexual orientation, differently abled, the list goes on.

Question to ponder: Are journalists who make us angry and hateful of other communities being true? Should we continue to listen to them?

7. Assist in media literacy and evaluation of media

Our information landscape has become so complicated that one of the core aspects of the job is to simply help people navigate it. (I was delighted when I read this, because this is precisely what we at BOOM are trying to do with Media Buddhi.)

As Ward writes, ""Journalism has a duty to inquire into the impact of journalism, media, and communication technology on the global public sphere and on their society.""

8. Use global comparisons

Countries flourish when they learn from each other, and journalism has a solid tradition of comparing and contrasting from other cultures and geographies. But this is a double-edged sword, because journalists can import both the best and the worst from other places.

POLITICAL

9. Critique the basic structure of institutions

We struggle to do this well because a lot of our energy as journalists is taken up with grappling with political leaders who seek to muzzle us. Even when that is not the case, we get distracted by our hunt for a narrative ('story'), heroes and villains. In the process, our focus on institutions wavers.

By 'institutions', I mean the judiciary, the electoral system, the executive, and pretty much anything that shapes our lives. The recent work by the Reporters' Collective is a good example of journalism that focuses on institutions.

10. Monitor basic liberties

Apart from individual goods, which we tackled above, journalism has a duty to ""promote and defend basic liberties around the world and to ask to what extent citizens are able to enjoy the full value of basic liberties, such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom from discrimination, and other constitutional protections."" (Stephen J. Ward)

In India, a good example of this type of reporting can be found at Article 14.

11. Encourage participation

News organizations are vocal about citizen participation at the electoral level. However, they fail when it comes to encouraging and harnessing citizen power beyond that.

Ward notes, ""journalism needs to monitor (and help make possible) citizen participation in public life and their ability to have a meaningfully influence on debate about government decisions.""

In India, Nikhil Pahwa and MediaNama have done this with their leadership on policy-related issues. So has Ritu Kapur with her focus on Citizen Journalism.

12. Report on diversity and representation

This is a major challenge for the Indian media, given that it is not at all representative. (The 'upper caste' accounts for more than 80% of all jobs while representing less than a third of India's castes.) It is not just groups of people but entire geographies that are ignored by the media. Until The News Minute started for example, southern India was by and large ignored.

ETHICAL

13. Take the public good perspective

A good question to ask before any journalist reports or publishes a story is, ""is my work contributing to the public good?"" If done honestly, this exercise reveals so much of journalism to be pointless. The best ones invariably ask themselves this question regularly.

Ward writes, ""When covering major public issues or major public events, such as elections, media should focus on how the public good is served or not served by proposal, promises, and actions. They should examine critically any claims by public officials, large private corporations, and any other agency to be acting for the public good.""

14. Highlight those who enhance public good

Ward declares that journalists should ""cover individuals and groups who enhance society through courageous and public-minded actions."" Journalists traditionally do this well, but in recent times, they have focused more on those who enhance public bad.

15. Support the exercise of public reason through dialogic media

This is similar to point no. 5 (Assist social bridging). ""How citizens speak to each other is almost as important as what they say"", Ward writes. ""At the core of the global media system should be deliberative spaces where reasonable citizens can robustly but respectfully exchange views and evaluate proposals.""

Why this framework works

Stephen J. Ward is obviously not the only journalism ethicist around. Journalism ethics is a specialized but well-represented sub-field of media ethics.

The reason I like Ward is that he not only advocates 'serious' and 'systematic' thinking around journalism ethics, but also 'radical' thinking. He argues that we need to ""rethink journalism from the ground up"". Crucially, he says this is an evolving task and contains three elements.

One, he believes that journalism ethics ought to be sustained by professional journalists. If it won't work out in the field, then it won't work out. Period.

Two, Ward believes journalism ethics have to fit into a 'post-digital' age.

And three, that they ought to incorporate global and non-Western perspectives.

What's missing?

Ask fellow journalists what their job is, and they will often say ""we speak truth to power"" or ""we hold power accountable"". In my previous piece, I argued that journalism is by its very nature, anti-establishment. A reader, Vinuth M Madinur, commented:

The challenge to old school journalism ethics comes from the fact that people want to get more ""balanced"", ""real"", ""unbiased"" view of the situation. If journalism is always anti-establishment, is it serving this need of its readers well? Hence it started with folks saying we shouldn't discount good work done by the government/a politician. This opened the flood gates for propaganda, as it becomes hard to distinguish the two.

Vinuth's comment partly inspired me to write this piece. I believe that his and other questions will find answers within Ward's framework.

There are very, many ways of speaking truth to power. And only one of them is by directly taking on the government, which is all but impossible to do anywhere in the world (except in the United States and some Western European countries, and even there, it's not a guarantee.)

I often ask myself which is more important for a journalist: to uphold the truth or to protect democracy when the two imperatives clash? And what about countries which are not democracies or democracies only in name? (India is increasingly becoming the latter.)

My answer to that question is one I've stated before: each country's journalistic mission ought to be recognized as unique based on legal, political, cultural, economic and ethical lenses.

So what sort of journalist can you be?

I finally figured out what sort of journalism I could do effectively. For reasons of temperament, skill and values, I prefer explanatory journalism, which is what I try to do with Media Buddhi. My beat is the information landscape.

It doesn't matter whether your focus as a journalist is sports or business or politics (or anything else). So long as you focus on one of the fifteen tasks, you're on solid ground. Also, investigative, explanatory and other journalistic methods are also there to be used, no matter what your focus. They are different tools and very many journalists finish their career running through them all.

But even if you aren't hitting any of those 15 goals, don't fret. I spent years hating the work I did as a journalist before I could build the escape velocity to do something else. And even then, it was only possible because I am privileged, a fact that I try not to forget.

Some of the best people I know are journalists who're doing the jobs their editors tell them to do, and they do them to the best of their ability and for long hours and through sickness and disaster.

Remembrance

When we speak of journalism ethics, things can get pretty abstract. It's useful to remind ourselves that journalists are people like all of us. In that spirit, I invoke the names of two journalists who embodied the best of journalistic ethics. They tragically died within a day of each other last week.

The first is Jaivanthi Hiriyur, also known as Mitra. She was a journalist but circumstances beyond her control meant she had to give it up. Instead, she built and ran a school for special needs children for decades, and breathed her last at the age of 74. Mitra brought grace, grit, and an original perspective to all matters, qualities that would have shone in a newspaper. She was my aunt.

The second is my friend Jaideep Sen, or Jaddu, who died of lung complications at the age of 41. Jaddu was a rare soul and was both astonishingly gifted and deeply reflective. A few years ago, Jaddu rebuilt his life at The New Indian Express in Chennai, after a courageous and inspiring battle with his own demons. Jaddu will live on in our memories and through his art and writing, but I lament the lost decades of his friendship and leadership. I leave an image of the kind of sketches he would do to add to his journalism. A few rapid strokes and—magic!

Around 5pm, the farmers cleared one carriageway, allowing vehicles to move from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.

The border blockade disrupted vehicular movement between Delhi and Ghaziabad, as traffic snarls spilt to other border points and connecting roads in Delhi as well as Uttar Pradesh.

As the farmers blocked the border around 7am without prior notice, motorists travelling to Ghaziabad from Delhi through the expressway during the morning rush hour were stuck.

At 7.37am, the Delhi Traffic Police used its Twitter handle to update the public about the closure of the carriageways at the Ghazipur-Ghaziabad border. Delhi Police’s public relation officer, Anil Mittal, said that the carriageway leading to Ghaziabad was closed for traffic, as farmers blocked the roads at the UP Gate border.

The carriageway leading to Delhi from Ghaziabad has already been closed for the last few days due to the farmers’ protest. “Traffic was diverted from Nizamuddin Khatta, Akshardham, and Ghazipur Chowk for onwards journey towards Ghaziabad via Anand Vihar, Apsara and Bhopura borders,” said Mittal.

It was the second time since Monday afternoon that the expressway was completely blocked by the farmers. The nearly hour-long blockade on Monday was cleared after the officials of the UP administration assured the farmers that nobody would be stopped from going towards the borders.

Rajveer Singh Jadhon, the president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (UP unit), said that the UP government has been harassing farmers in the state and those coming from Uttarakhand, by stopping their tractor-trolleys and other vehicles in different places.

Jadhon said that despite assurances, nearly 35 trolleys and 50 four-wheelers ferrying farmers were stopped at Rampur and Pilibhit on Monday night. “The police personnel misbehaved with the farmers and forced them to return. We blocked the UP Gate border with our tractors to express our protest against the UP administration and demand the release of farmers. We cleared one carriageway for vehicles going to Ghaziabad after the farmers were allowed to move towards Delhi,” said Jadhon.

The border remained closed between 7am and 5pm on Tuesday, following which the carriageway going towards Ghaziabad from Delhi was opened after a meeting between farmer leaders and officials of the UP administration, who assured that the farmers, who had been stopped at Rampur, Pilibhit and Bilaspur, were allowed to move towards the UP Gate border.

Praveen Kumar, inspector general (Meerut range), of the Uttar Pradesh police, said, “The carriageway was vacated by the protesters and we have assured that all their issues will be taken up. They were demanding that their vehicles must not be stopped from approaching the UP Gate from other areas in UP. But we have to take up checks to ascertain that no anti-social element gets in. We discussed with other officers and got the issue resolved. The carriageway was vacated around 5pm.”

The Singhu and Tikri borders, where thousands of farmers are protesting, continued to remain shut while one carriageway of the Delhi-Noida link road at the Chilla border is open for vehicles entering Delhi from Noida. Motorists going to Noida are being diverted to other borders such as Delhi-Noida-Direct Flyway, Kalindi Kunj, New Ashok Nagar, Kondli and Dallupura.

Undeterred by the winter chill, thousands of farmers have stayed put at various border points of Delhi for the past nine days as part of their protest against the Centre's farm laws.

""At this juncture, we have transport unions, retail businesses and other associated groups who have shown solidarity with us. Our movement is not just about farmers,"" Prasad said.

He claimed that these laws seek to allow foreign intervention in agriculture and said this will allow corporates to monopolise the farm sector.

AIKS also demanded that the government unconditionally withdraw cases filed across India on protesting farmers.

His roots in agriculture was instrumental in aiding him to launch the ‘Kudimaramathu’ scheme and also ensure that the state bagged the national award in water management, Palaniswami said.

Hitting back at the DMK Chief over his ‘fake’ farmer barb targetting him, the CM said agriculture was his primary occupation and he was a farmer since childhood. “What does he know about farmers? How do you differentiate a fake from a genuine farmer?” he asked when a reporter sought his reaction to Stalin’s remark that the chief minister was a “fake” farmer.

“I construe that he is insulting farmers by making such unwarranted remark. If you ask me, I can talk about agriculture. But what does he know he doesn’t know what profession he is in. Stalin is perhaps the only person who is surviving without being in any profession,” Palaniswami alleged, hitting out at the DMK president.

The CM who was in this southern coastal district to review the measures being taken by the administration to prevent the spread of COVID-19 besides launch numerous projects, said, “agriculture is my primary occupation. I have been a farmer since my childhood and people of my locality know it. They know I worked hard.” “I don’t need Stalin’s certificate to prove to be a farmer,” he said. Palaniswami, who had earlier taunted the DMK chief for speaking about the Centre’s reforms in agriculture sector, saying he lacked knowledge on the subject, questioned Stalin’s knowledge on farming, again, and wondered how he could differentiate a fake farmer from a genuine without knowing the subject.

In fact, his background as a farmer had helped him come out with several schemes including the ‘Kudimaramathu’ programme for the benefit of farmers and also steer the state to bag the national award in water management. He also recalled his efforts on getting 10 TMC water for parched Chennai from the Krishna river in Andhra Pradesh.

Further, he had initiated talks with his Kerala counterpart aiming to resolve the long pending water issues between the two states. “But what has Stalin done for water management in the state when DMK was in power. He is responsible for the Tuticorin incident (police firing on protesters during the anti-Sterlite stir on May 22, 2018, which claimed 13 lives),” the CM said.

He accused the DMK president of being a “liar” for blaming the AIADMK government for the Sterlite police firing incident. “During the DMK rule, as a minister Stalin had informed the assembly that land was being allotted for Sterlites expansion programme and that the company was investing Rs 1,500 crore for the same,” Palaniswami said.

Though Stalin had done everything, he blamed the state government, the chief minister said and claimed that the police firing would not have happened had the expansion not been permitted.

CHANDIGARH: BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh on Friday alleged that a ""misleading and deceptive narrative"" is being created on the agriculture bills because of which ""gross misunderstanding"" has spread among farmers. Urging farmers to withdraw their protest after the Centre's promise to make seven amendments to the new agri laws keeping in view the objections raised by them, Chugh said the protesters should not get misled by the ""false propaganda"".The Centre's seven undertakings including that the MSP and mandis would continue as it is, should dispel all doubts of the agitating farmers and they should repose their faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , he said in a statement here.Several farmers are protesting at Delhi borders seeking repeal of the new laws enacted by the Centre recently.Chugh said the Modi government has all along been empowering farmers sincerely in a bid to double their income and make agriculture profitable.Whether it is the decision to transfer money directly to the bank account of the farmers, MSP increases or pension scheme, our focus has been to empower farmers, he said.Chugh said these reforms will boost investment in the agriculture sector, through better assured prices, and contracts for farm services.""In contract farming, the agreement is made between the farmer and buyer even before the crop is sown. Farmer already knows what MSP he can get for his crop. So, the farmer will negotiate a price above the MSP,"" he said.Chugh rebutted the ""misleading propaganda"" that corporate houses would grab farmers' land.""No corporate house or private buyers can touch the land of a farmer"", he said, adding that the laws provide adequate protection to farmers on that count.The impact of these reforms will transform India's agriculture and food processing industries, he said.Private sector investments will pour in across the entire cold chain, reducing losses and ensuring better prices for farmers, he said.Bringing farmers together through farmer producer organisations will enable bargaining capacity and economies of scale for even small farmers, he said.Chugh said under the new laws farmers have got the freedom to sell their produce anywhere in the country. It is sure to ensure farmer welfare and revive the rural economy, he added.""These decisions have identified the farmer as a producer and his produce as a product.

The farmer unions also said that protests will be held in all district headquarters to press their demand for the repeal of the new farm laws.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said he too will observe a day-long fast on Monday and appealed to the central government to shun ego and scrap the legislation. The farmers will hold the hunger strike from 8 am to 5 pm today.

On Sunday, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar met Home Minister Amit Shah. Tomar was accompanied by BJP leaders from Punjab. It is to be noted that Tomar along with Commer Minister Piyush Goyal had led the Centre's talks with the protesting farmers.

But the farmers who are protesting at Singhu border, Tikri border and Delhi-Uttar Pradesh are facing several issues now and are hoping that the ongoing stalemate ends soon.

Here are 10 major issues protesting farmers are facing now:

1. As the temperature in falling in Delhi adn adjoining areas, farmers, specially senior farmers, are finding it tough to cope with the change in temperature.

2. Since the farmers are away from their homes for 19 days now and those who are not economically sound are now facing the pinch of depleting funds too.

3. Some reports claimed that there is a rift between farmers' unions on blocking the highways and there are many farmers who want to open the borders for normal transport.

4. Farmers are also facing issue of contracting coronavirus as it is impoosible to maintain social distancing at the protest site.

5. Though the farmers are claiming that they have the food items to last for six months, it seems highly unlikely that they would be able to sustain for so long on the road.

6. One of the major issues in front of the farmers is government's stand over the laws. The Centre has made it clear that it it will not repeal the laws while the farmers are putting pressure on the government to repeal the three laws.

7. It is learnt that one group of farmers want to end the protest after accepting the amendments suggested by the Centre but there are farmers unions which are unwilling to call off the strike unless the government repeal the laws. This lack of unity has become another issue.

8. Another issue which the farmers are facing is the entry of some anti-national elements in the protest.

9. Farmers are also facing trouble of sanitation as the mobile toilets which are installed for the farmers at the protest site are not cleaned on time.

10. Many women farmers have returned home after few days because they were finding it tough to use dirty toilets and were unable to bath in the open.",india,"It is to be noted that Tomar along with Commer Minister Piyush Goyal had led the Centre's talks with the protesting farmers.

Ahead of the talks, Union Home Minister Amit Shah held deliberations with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on December 2 on ways to dispel concerns over the new farm laws.

Farmers from Punjab and Haryana will leave for Vigyan Bhawan by bus from Singhu border between 9 am-10 am. The meeting is scheduled to take place with the government at 12 noon and 35 leaders of different farmer organizations will reach Vigyan Bhavan.

Police have shifted the farmers agitating on the Noida border to the Dr Ambedkar Memorial Park in Noida. The farmers have said that if the results aren't achieved by 2 pm, then they will come to Delhi.

After the meeting held in Vigyan Bhawan with the government, all the farmer leaders can gather at the Singhu border in which the next strategy will be chalked out.

On the route from Noida-Delhi, the farmers have now put up tents due to which people going to Delhi from Noida on Thursday may face a lot of trouble in the morning. Chandrashekhar Azad of Bhima Army may reach Singhu Border to meet farmers at 10 am.

As part of their 'Delhi Chalo' march, farmers have currently been staging protests at four busy border points of the national capital - Singhu, Noida, Ghazipur and Tikri - to press their demands under heavy police deployment. Leaders of around 35 farmer organisations held a meeting which was also attended by Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait at the Singhu border.

""The Centre should call a special session of Parliament to repeal the new farm laws. We will continue our agitation till these laws are repealed,"" Krantikari Kisan Union president Darshan Pal told reporters after the meeting. He accused the Centre of dividing the farmers organisations by projecting the ongoing protests as Punjab-centric.

Representatives of farmers organisations from other parts of the country will also be involved under Kisan Samyukt Morcha to decide the future course of action against the new farm laws, he said. Pal said that representatives of farmer organisations will give their point-wise objections to the Union ministers at a meeting scheduled to take place on Thursday.

Another farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chadoni said that if the Centre does not withdraw the laws, more steps will be taken in the coming days to press their demands. According to Tikait, all the farmers' unions want that MSP should be turned into a law and the three central farm laws repealed.

""The government had asked us to give in writing what were the problems with the laws. There would have been room for a written statement had we been looking for an amendment in the laws, but we just have one demand - completely doing away with the laws,"" he told PTI. He also said that the farmers have rejected the idea of a committee.

""There are simply too many committees in the country. There have been several committee reports in the past but they don't result in anything. Committees are created essentially to avoid an uprising. I have been part of the farmers' movement for nearly 30 years, so I know that much,"" Tikait said.

""If the government does not come to a decision in the next few days, we will increase pressure on NH8 and NH2, we have been in talks with our farmer brothers in Rajasthan,"" he threatened.

Agitating farmers on Wednesday demanded that the Centre convene a special session of Parliament and repeal the new farm laws as they threatened to block other roads in Delhi and ""take more steps"" if it failed to do so. As the number of protestors swelled at Delhi's border points, the apex body of transporters -- All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), representing about 95 lakh truckers and other entities -- extended its support to the farmers and threatened to halt operations in northern India from December 8 if the government fails to address concerns of the farming community.

The protest at the Delhi-Noida route (Chilla Boarder) intensified leading to the closure of the key route for the second consecutive day as more farmers from Firozabad, Meerut, Noida and Etawah started gathering there. Later, one carriage was opened for motorists. More farmers from Firozabad, Meerut, Noida and Etawah started gathering.

Azad is likely to join farmers on Thursday at the Singh Border where thousands have been protesting for the last seven days. Azad had joined protest being held at the Ghazipur Border near UP Gate. On Wednesday, around 2,00 farmers who have been camping near Ghazipur Border since Saturday refused to leave the site unless their demands are met.

The farmers who are mainly from Uttar Pradesh have also been joined by groups from Uttarakhand. A protestor camping at the Ghazipur border said farmers are here despite facing huge losses back home. More farmers also started gathering at Singhu border, one of the major protest sites.

According to police, checking of vehicles has also been intensified at the border points as a precautionary measure in view of the 'Delhi Chalo' protest march by farmers. Away from the comfort of their homes and undeterred by the winter chill, farmers camping at Delhi's Singhu border against the Centre's agriculture reform laws say they are prepared for a long haul and will not leave until their demands are met.

The farmers, who have come from the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana, start their day with a bath at petrol pumps, where they also wash their clothes. They return the favour by cleaning the petrol pumps. Then they cook on the roadside. Anyone visiting the protest site is also offered a wholesome meal which includes dal, rice, paranthas and kheer on different days.

At lunch time, the protesters sat in rows for a langar organised by several non-profit organisations.

After relishing lip-smacking meals, some went back to rest on their trolleys, while others listened intently to their leaders speaking from podiums.

Punjabi and Haryanvi songs blared from speakers fitted on tractors as youngsters in jeeps and cars filled service lanes in the area. Many one-stop kiosks along the road have been doling out items of daily need, including inner wear, hair oil, skin cream, socks and soaps, for free to the protesters. Their numbers has been increasing every day, Rajinder Singh Kohli from Mohali said.

Fewer vehicles plied on roads amid the bandh called by protesting farmer unions. App-based cabs, auto-rickshaws and DTC buses, however, could been seen on the roads. Most of the shops on the roads leading to the Singhu border remained shut.

Agitating farmer unions have threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during their ‘chakka jam’ protest from 11 am to 3 pm as part of their stir. Emergency services will be exempted during the bandh.

In its wake, the Delhi Police beefed up security at all border points and made arrangements to maintain law and order across the city, including market places.

The bandh has been called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, all of which were passed by Parliament recently.

The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.

However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.",india-news,"More farmers from Punjab and Haryana trickled in at the Singhu border on tractor-trolleys and cars on Tuesday amid heavy security presence as a nationwide protest called their representatives against the Centre’s agri laws was underway.

RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav addresses an election meeting on upcoming Bihar Assembly polls in Bhagalpur district.(ANI)

Yadav, who is the Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial face, said he is running an issue-based campaign in the assembly polls which was resonating with the masses and come November 10, the day of the counting of votes, “Bihar will witness a new dawn”.

In an interview with PTI, Yadav said for the first time in history a promise has been made to the youth of Bihar that 10 lakh jobs will be provided with the “first stroke of the pen in the very first cabinet meeting”, if voted to power.

Asked how many seats he is expecting to win, the former Bihar deputy chief minister said, “I am no astrologer but the public reception during canvassing gives me confidence that we have the blessings of the great people of Bihar and they have decided to entrust us with a huge responsibility.”

Yadav expressed confidence that the Mahagathbandhan will get a “thumping two-thirds majority”.

“I can confidently tell you that deposits will be forfeited of NDA candidates in maximum constituencies. Come 10th November, Bihar will witness a new dawn,” he asserted.

Talking about his major promises and poll plank, he said that if voted to power, providing jobs to unemployed youth would be his topmost priority.

“Ours would be a responsible government which will have a responsive administration. Employment, health, education and industries are the sectors which have been neglected in 15 years of (Chief Minister) Nitish Kumar’s rule. We will revive and transform these sectors,” the 30-year-old leader said.

Asked about Lok Janshakti Party chief Chirag Paswan walking out of the NDA and whether there was a possibility of a post poll tie-up with him, Yadav said Paswan has already made it clear that he is with the BJP and wishes to replace Nitish Kumar with a BJP CM.

On the third front formed by the likes of All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, he said Biharis have the highest political awareness in the country and “these A, B, C parachute alliances of the BJP will have no impact on this election”.

Asked whether the grand alliance, if voted to power, will blunt the farm laws the Centre has brought in with a state level legislation like in Punjab, Yadav said, “Yes, absolutely we will bring in a legislation in the first assembly session that shall nullify these three anti-farmer bills. This is a commitment in our Mahagathbandhan manifesto.”

The three farm bills -- the Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 -- were passed by Parliament recently. Subsequently, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the bills.

The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Congress, many other opposition parties as well as several farmers organisations have been protesting against these legislations, claiming that these will harm the interests of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.

The Centre has asserted that these new laws will be beneficial for farmers and will increase their income. Yadav said there is a “huge resentment” among people against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar primarily because of his “desire for power and discriminatory attitude towards the unemployed, migrants and the poor during Covid pandemic”.

“With his PR of about thousands of crores he had so far managed to create a facade of ‘Sushasan’ which we have pulled down with facts and figures. Now, the people of Bihar have come to know that Nitish Kumar has ruined the state,” Yadav alleged.

The RJD leader said he is going to people with a vision for their problems and is raising real life issues in his campaign. Asked about talk that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign blitz may work in favour of the NDA, Yadav said twelve and a half crore Biharis have decided and made up their mind to vote on real life issues like unemployment, migration, corruption, poverty, inflation etc.

In the three phase election -- October 28, November 3 and November 7 -- RJD is leading the Mahagathbandhan, contesting 144 seats, followed by the Congress which is fighting on 70 seats, CPI(ML) 19 seats, CPI (six) and CPI(M) four seats.
