Dismissing a petition filed by HM Vishwanath, a class -1 contractor from Bengaluru, justice B Veerappa has noted that reservation has been provided based on the principles of distributive justice to protect the interests of weaker sections of the society, particularly those belonging to SC-ST category. In a notification issued on July 17, 2017, the state government provided up to 17.15% reservation for contractors belonging to SC category and up to 6.95% reservation for contractors belonging to ST category, with respect to contracts not exceeding Rs 50 lakhs. For this purpose, the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurement Rules ,2016 was amended to insert rule 27 (A). The rules also provide that only in instances wherein no contractor from these two categories submit a response even after two attempts, a contract relating to such works may be tendered among others\"\n",
